abstract = {Rare diseases (RD) are conditions affecting fewer than 1 in 2000 persons, with over 7000 largely genetic RDs affecting 3.5 %-5.9 % of the global population, or approximately 262.9–446.2 million people. The substantial healthcare burden and costs, such as the $1 trillion annual expense in the USA, highlight the urgent need for improved RD management. The International Rare Diseases Research Consortium (IRDiRC) addresses this need through global collaboration, aiming for timely and accurate diagnosis, development of 1000 new therapies, and methodologies to measure impact by 2027. IRDiRC's initiatives include biannual meetings and workshops, like the AI-focused workshop in October 2023. This identified AI as crucial for advancing RD research and proposed a Framework for AI to enhance the RD patient journey by addressing efficiency and quality of life through modular solutions mapped to critical stages. The Framework integrates diverse data sources to improve diagnosis, treatment, and impact assessment, reflecting a holistic, cross-sector approach. By guiding multi-stakeholder efforts, the Framework aims to harness AI’s potential to significantly improve rare disease care.}

abstract = {Objective
Artificial intelligence (AI) shows promise in surgery, but its role in plastic surgery education remains underexplored. This review evaluates the current landscape of AI in plastic surgery education.
Design
A systematic search was conducted on August 11, 2024, across PubMed, CINAHL, IEEE, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar using terms related to AI, plastic surgery, and education. Original research articles focusing on AI in plastic surgery education were included, excluding correspondence, reviews, book chapters, theses, corrections, and non–peer-reviewed or non-English articles. Two investigators independently screened studies and synthesized data. ROBINS-I was used to assess bias.
Results
Fifteen studies were included, with 13 evaluating large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, Microsoft Bing, and Google Bard. ChatGPT-4 outperformed other models on In-Service Examinations (average score of 72.7%) and demonstrated potential as a teaching assistant in plastic surgery education. AI-generated personal statements were comparable to human-written ones. However, ChatGPT showed inaccuracies in generating surgical protocols. ChatGPT demonstrated its ability to provide qualitative predictions, forecasting survey results that indicated limited current use of AI in plastic surgery education but support for further AI research. a study combined ChatGPT with DALL-E 2, a generative model, to create acceptable educational images. Machine learning was used in 1 study for evaluating surgical skill and providing real-time feedback during liposuction. Nine studies had low risk of bias, while 6 had moderate risk.
Conclusions
AI demonstrates potential as an educational tool in plastic surgery. However, limitations of evidence, such as AI model uncertainties, introduce ambiguity. While AI cannot replicate the expertise of seasoned surgeons, it shows promise for foundational learning and skill assessment. Developing authenticity guidelines and enhancing AI capabilities are essential for its effective, ethical integration into plastic surgery education.}

This review was conducted to understand how generative AI can play an important role in pharmacovigilance and improving drug safety monitoring. Data from previously published articles and news items were reviewed in order to obtain information. We used PubMed and Google Scholar as our search engines, and keywords (pharmacovigilance, artificial intelligence, machine learning, drug safety, and patient safety) were used. In toto, we reviewed 109 articles published till 31st January 2024, and the obtained information was interpreted, compiled, evaluated, and conclusions were reached. Generative AI has transformative potential in pharmacovigilance, showcasing benefits, such as enhanced adverse event detection, data-driven risk prediction, and optimized drug development. By making it easier to process and analyze big datasets, generative artificial intelligence has applications across a variety of disease states. Machine learning and automation in this field can streamline pharmacovigilance procedures and provide a more efficient way to assess safety-related data. Nevertheless, more investigation is required to determine how this optimization affects the caliber of safety analyses.

As AI continues to grow, it will be crucial for healthcare providers and our community as hepatologists to understand the implications and impact of this growth and what this means for our practice and patients. We draw from existing AI frameworks, principles of medical ethics, as well as quality healthcare principles to propose our framework for AI in hepatology. Our proposed framework includes patient-centered care, non-maleficence and safety, equity, transparency, accountability, and security and privacy. For each of these topics, we discuss examples relevant to hepatology. We also propose an action plan for hepatologists on how each of these principles can be upheld in our day-to-day practice. While many hepatology specific AI applications are currently being tested in research studies, they have not yet made it to “prime time.” As a result, the hepatology community has time to consider governance structures to put in place in preparation for the inherent challenges that come with AI implementation and integration into clinical care to ensure that care is responsible, ethical, safe, and secure. With careful and conscientious planning, the inclusion of relevant stakeholders, and laying the groundwork for governance, AI can improve quality of health care in hepatology with efficiency, improved safety, and equity.}

Scientific research has revealed only a minuscule fraction of the enzymes that evolution has generated to power life’s essential chemical reactions—and an even tinier fraction of the vast universe of possible enzymes. Beyond the enzymes already annotated lie an astronomical number of biocatalysts that could enable sustainable chemical production, degrade toxic pollutants, and advance disease diagnosis and treatment. For the past few decades, directed evolution has been a powerful strategy for reshaping enzymes to access new chemical transformations: by harnessing nature’s existing diversity as a starting point and taking inspiration from nature’s most powerful design process, evolution, to modify enzymes incrementally. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) methods have started revolutionizing how we understand and compose the language of life. In this perspective, we discuss a vision for AI-driven enzyme discovery to unveil a world of enzymes that transcends biological evolution and perhaps offers a route to genetically encoding almost any chemistry.}

The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) with high-throughput techniques has emerged as a powerful solution, revolutionizing the discovery and optimization of HEMs. This review highlights the synergistic paradigm of AI and high-throughput methods in HEMs research. High-throughput experimental approaches enable rapid screening of multiple compositions, while complementary computational methods provide theoretical insights and accelerate predictions of material properties. Machine learning models, ranging from supervised learning to unsupervised learning offer robust tools for predicting material properties, optimizing compositions, and discovering new materials. Generative models and inverse design approaches further enable the creation of novel HEMs with desired properties. The multi - objective optimization framework provides an effective means to find the best balance among multiple performance indicators. Large language models process and integrate massive amounts of data and extract key information, providing data-driven insights for the discovery of complex materials. The integration of these techniques into a closed-loop development system enables continuous feedback between experimental data, computational predictions, and machine learning models, thereby accelerating the discovery and optimization of HEMs, which not only streamlines the exploration of vast compositional spaces but also provides multi-scale insights into material behavior. As AI continues to evolve and integrate with emerging technologies, the future of HEM research holds great promise for sustainable development and accelerate their translation from the laboratory to practical applications.}

abstract = {Introduction
Feedback is at the core of competency-based medical education. Learner perceptions of the evaluation process influence how feedback is utilized. Systems emphasize a fixed mindset, prioritizing evaluation over growth. Embracing growth mindset culture, the belief that ability is acquired through effort and human capabilities can be developed over time, will allow learners to gain greater benefits from feedback. Transitioning from fixed mindset language (FML) to growth mindset language (GML) will require faculty training. Artificial intelligence (AI) can assist faculty with incorporating GML concepts in written feedback. The aim of this study was to assess the ability of AI to assist in changing FML feedback statements into statements with GML.
Methods
A qualitative study was performed utilizing a sample of 83 summative and formative feedback statements provided to students (37) and residents (46) from surgery clerkship and national SIMPL-inguinal hernia evaluations. Of these 83 statements, a reviewer coded 41 statements as using GML and 42 using FML. Original statements identified as using FML were entered into the Google Chrome "Help me write" tool, a writing aid using Generative AI. The AI tool was prompted with the statement "rewrite using growth mindset language:," followed by an original FML statement. A dataset containing a combination of AI-altered and original statements, 99 statements in all, was provided to two additional blinded reviewers trained in GML concepts. Reviewers evaluated statements as predominantly GML or FML and commented on their perception of AI use in statements. Reviewer agreement was adjudicated by the original coder.
Results
Of the 41 original GML statements, coders correctly identified 37 (90.2%) as using GML. Of the 26 original FML statements, coders correctly identified all 26 (100%) as using FML. Of the AI-modified FML to GML statements, coders correctly identified 17 of 18 (94.4%) as using GML. They correctly identified 56.3% as AI-modified and 44.8% as not AI-modified statements. They disagreed on AI use in 39.4% of statements. AI-assistance was unrecognized in 16 (8.1%) statements and mistaken for use in 47 (23.7%) statements.
Conclusions
AI was successful at modifying FML statements into feedback containing GML, and in a way that was not obviously AI-generated. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates that AI can be a helpful tool for faculty to increase the use of GML in written feedback. While AI cannot perfectly create GML feedback without initial input and understanding from faculty, it does serve as a promising educational aid. As the body of work on using GML in surgical education grows, the better AI can assist in the generation of quality feedback.}

Inhibiting phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) has emerged as a promising strategy for AD treatment. In this study, we employed a synergistic approach combining generative recurrent neural network (RNN)-driven combinatorial compound design, virtual screening, and structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis to discover novel PDE4 inhibitors. Utilizing α-mangostin as a hit compound (half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) = 1.31 μmol/L), we identified a novel PDE4 inhibitor, 13d (IC50 = 72.8 nmol/L) with moderate liver microsomal stability (rat liver microsomes (RLM), t1/2 = 32.4 min). In vitro activity results indicated that 13d exhibited favorable anti-inflammatory effects and promising neuroprotective activity. In vivo experiments demonstrated that 13d significantly improved AlCl3-induced zebrafish AD model by inhibiting PDE4 and reducing inflammatory cytokine. Further, 13d significantly alleviated AlCl3/D-galactose-induced AD mouse model. These findings highlight the potent PDE4 inhibitor 13d with promising anti-AD activity, underscoring the potential of artificial intelligence-driven drug discovery for novel therapeutic agents for AD.}

While publications applying AI in allergy and immunology have increased, clinical implementation substantially lags behind other specialties. By mid-2024, over 1,000 FDA-approved AI-enabled medical devices existed, but none specifically addressed allergy and immunology. This gap partly reflects our field's limited reliance on imaging, which facilitated early AI breakthroughs in radiology and pathology. This narrative review examines recent AI developments, including Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI agents, evaluating their applicability to allergy and immunology practice. We analyze current and potential applications, emphasizing those demonstrating clinical value, while identifying implementation barriers amplified by allergic diseases' unique complexities, including data privacy concerns, bias, reliability constraints, and evolving regulatory frameworks. To bridge the persistent research-to-implementation gap, we propose a 6-point roadmap: (1) prioritize impactful applications, (2) define clinically relevant benchmarks, (3) enforce rigorous governance, (4) transition to operationalization, (5) promote clinical adoption through trustworthy AI, and (6) establish lifecycle management. This roadmap builds upon established implementation frameworks while incorporating critical field-specific considerations unique to allergy and immunology. Through this approach, we aim to provide a perspective for advancing AI in allergy and immunology from academic promise to tangible clinical benefit.}

This paper introduces Blockchain-Assisted Explainable Decision Traces (BAXDT), a novel architecture designed to enhance the transparency and auditability of AI systems. BAXDT creates comprehensive, immutable records for each AI decision by integrating model outputs, SHAP-based XAI summaries, a novel Explanation Density Metric, and detailed model/data context into a unified JSON trace. The 0.80 threshold for the Explanation Density Metric was empirically supported by Kneedle-based automatic threshold detection. The BAXDT architecture leverages blockchain by recording a cryptographic hash of each decision trace on-chain, while the full trace is stored off-chain. The system's effectiveness was demonstrated through a multi-faceted evaluation: simulations across three diverse public datasets (medical, financial, educational) confirmed its domain-agnostic applicability; a scalability analysis of up to 20,000 traces demonstrated its efficient and linear performance; and a successful deployment on the Ethereum Sepolia public testnet verified its real-world viability. A case study on text data further underscored the framework's flexibility. BAXDT provides a robust framework for documenting AI decisions - what, why, based on what, and when - thereby fostering trustworthy AI and supporting regulatory compliance.}

abstract = {Objective
We developed a novel slit-lamp photography (SLP) generative adversarial network (GAN) model using limited data to supplement and improve the performance of an artificial intelligence (AI)–based microbial keratitis (MK) screening model.
Design
Cross-sectional study.
Subjects
Slit-lamp photographs of 67 healthy and 36 MK eyes were prospectively and retrospectively collected at a tertiary care ophthalmology clinic at a large academic institution.
Methods
We trained the GAN model StyleGAN2-ADA on healthy and MK SLPs to generate synthetic images. To assess synthetic image quality, we performed a visual Turing test. Three cornea fellows tested their ability to identify 20 images each of (1) real healthy, (2) real diseased, (3) synthetic healthy, and (4) synthetic diseased. We also used Kernel Inception Distance (KID) to quantitatively measure realism and variation of synthetic images. Using the same dataset used to train the GAN model, we trained 2 DenseNet121 AI models to grade SLP images as healthy or MK with (1) only real images and (2) real supplemented with GAN-generated images.
Main Outcome Measures
Classification performance of MK screening models trained with only real images compared to a model trained with both limited real and supplemented synthetic GAN images.
Results
For the visual Turing test, the fellows on average rated synthetic images as good quality (83.3% ± 12.0% of images), and synthetic and real images were found to depict pertinent anatomy and pathology for accurate classification (96.3% ± 2.19% of images). These experts could distinguish between real and synthetic images (accuracy: 92.5% ± 9.01%). Analysis of KID score for synthetic images indicated realism and variation. The MK screening model trained on both limited real and supplemented synthetic data (area under the receiver–operator characteristic curve: 0.93, bootstrapping 95% CI: 0.77–1.0) outperformed the model trained with only real data (area under the receiver–operator characteristic curve: 0.76, 95% CI: 0.50–1.0), with an improvement of 0.17 (95% CI: 0–0.4; 2-tailed t test P = 0.076).
Conclusions
Artificial intelligence–based MK classification may be improved by supplementation of limited real training data with synthetic data generated by GANs.

Adopting a four-wave, time-lagged research design, data were gathered from 849 employed adults in South Korea, yielding 363 usable responses. The measurement model was evaluated using confirmatory factor analysis, which demonstrated the distinctiveness of the core constructs. Structural equation modeling assessed the hypothesized relationships and revealed that OPP had no direct effect on innovation; rather, its impact was mediated by PCB, which occurs when employees perceive the unyielding demands of an organization as violating mutual obligations, and subsequently by KHB, which refers to individuals withholding work-related information. This chain of unfavorable perceptions and behaviors ultimately diminishes organization-level innovation capacity. Furthermore, AITA functioned as a crucial buffer in the link between OPP and PCB, signifying that employees who were more receptive to AI tools were less likely to interpret perfectionistic standards as unfair. This study’s findings enhance the current theoretical discourse by highlighting a multi-level explanatory process that elucidates how externally imposed performance pressure erodes innovation potential. The results also demonstrate technological acceptance’s pivotal role in mitigating such challenges.}

Through a systematic content analysis, this paper aims to examine the current use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the services of the top 100 US university libraries and explores the key factors that influence the adoption of this technology. It seeks to provide actionable strategic recommendations for library administrators. These recommendations aim to help libraries accelerate their intelligent service transformation while maintaining their academic resource advantages and humanistic traditions, and to establish a solid theoretical and empirical foundation for future research.
Design/methodology/approach
The authors analyse the current status of libraries adopting AI technologies and applying them to patron services, which include intelligent retrieval services, intelligent reference services, intelligent guided tour services and intelligent ID recognition services, among others. Firstly, the authors visit the official websites of the top 100 US university libraries to collect information. Subsequently, the prevalence of AI technologies is statistically analysed, and several excellent practice cases are selected. Finally, based on the data obtained from the content analysis, the impact of university rankings on the adoption of AI technologies in US university libraries is analysed.
Findings
The study finds that AI technologies are widely applied in the services of US university libraries, but there are differences in the adoption rates across different services. Almost all libraries have adopted intelligent retrieval and recommendation technology (99%). In terms of intelligent reference services, more than half of the libraries have used AI technologies (53%). Intelligent guided tour technology is also widely adopted (95%). The application of intelligent ID recognition technology in libraries is equally common (98%). Furthermore, more than half of the libraries have begun to explore generative AI technologies (61%). Additionally, the study further discovers that there is a significant negative correlation between university rankings and the number of AI technologies adopted by libraries. This indicates that top-ranked universities are more likely to introduce a variety of AI technologies in their library services.
Research limitations/implications
The study’s implications include constructing an analytical framework to assess AI in library services and identifying key adoption factors. It explores AI’s impact on service diversity and the popularity of different services. Notably, it finds a link between university rankings and AI adoption, offering insights into the relationship between tech adoption and institutional reputation.
Originality/value

Five themes and 12 subthemes were categorized from 27 original interview documents as follows: (1) diverse reflections on human-machine symbiosis, which includes the interplay between substitution and assistance, researchers shaping the potential of generative artificial intelligence, and acceptance of generative artificial intelligence with alacrity; (2) multiple factors of the usage experience, including individual characteristics and various usage scenarios; (3) research paradigm reshaping in the infancy stage, which involves full-process groundbreaking assistive tools and emergence of new research paths; (4) application risks of generative artificial intelligence, including intrinsic limitations of generative artificial intelligence and academic integrity and medical ethics; and (5) the co-improvement of technology and literacy, which concerns reinforcement needs for generative artificial intelligence literacy, development of nursing research generative artificial intelligence and urgent need for artificial intelligence–generated content detection tools. In this context, the first 4 themes form the rocket of the human-machine symbiosis journey. Only when humans fully leverage the advantages of machines (generative artificial intelligence) and overcome their shortcomings can this human-machine symbiosis journey reach the correct future direction (fifth theme).
Conclusions
This study explored the experiences and perceptions of nurse researchers interacting with generative artificial intelligence, which was a “symbiotic journey” full of twists and turns, and provides a reference and basis for achieving harmonious coexistence between nurse researchers and generative artificial intelligence in the future. Nurse researchers, policy makers, and application developers can use the conclusions of this study to further promote the application of generative artificial intelligence in nursing research, policy making, and product development.}

BACKGROUND
The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine has increased dramatically. Its utilization will expand in cardiothoracic (CT) surgery, altering current practice. We surveyed CT surgeons to gain insight into their beliefs, hopes, and fears regarding AI.
METHODS
A 25-question instrument addressing AI use in CT surgery was created, focusing on the domains of role, value, effect, threat, and regulation of AI. In coordination with several cardiothoracic surgical societies, the survey was electronically distributed to and completed by the societies’ members. After filtering, 424 complete de-identified responses were collected and analyzed. Answers were scored on a Likert scale and collapsed into categories for analysis.
RESULTS
There was a broad range of responses that varied from very negative to very positive. Most statistically significant differences in responses among demographics primarily related to the role and value of AI in clinical care areas. Specifically, female surgeons, younger surgeons, and thoracic (as opposed to cardiac) surgeons envisioned a smaller role for AI. Physicians felt that regulation of AI should come from professional societies and federal governments, and supported a proactive approach to the integration of AI into CT surgery, including engagement with industry and sharing of specialty specific texts and databases.
CONCLUSIONS
As AI is further implemented in medicine, CT surgery faces a rapidly changing landscape. Expectedly, feelings among physicians are mixed. However, there are clear areas of agreement as to the benefit of AI integration and broad support for proactive approaches to integration.}

abstract = {The technology-driven Industry 4.0 paradigm is in a prosperous stage. Meanwhile, the industry is shifting towards a more human-centric, sustainable, and resilient paradigm, which is envisioned as a value-oriented Industry 5.0. Embodied Artificial Intelligence (AI) has shown promising benefits, but challenges persist in the proper orchestration between AI and human beings. Human-Centric Artificial Intelligence (HCAI) emphasizes that AI systems should enhance and complement human abilities rather than replace humans. It focuses on the interaction between humans and AI, aims to improve human well-being, and ensures that AI technologies are consistent with human values and needs. HCAI prioritizes user experience and ethical considerations by following three principles: being inspired by human intelligence, guided by human impact, and augmenting human capabilities. This paper examines the growing trend of deep integration between AI and human intelligence in industries, emphasizing that AI development necessitates the interdependence of technology, people, and ethics to create reliable, safe, and trustworthy systems. This paper conducts a detailed analysis of the evolution stages and modes of human-AI collaboration in industry. Based on an in-depth examination of enablers of HCAI models in industry, this paper examines HCAI applications for the product lifecycle management. Social barriers, technology challenges, and future research directions of HCAI are underscored, respectively. We believe that our effort lays a foundation for unlocking the power of HCAI during the transition from Industry 4.0 to Industry 5.0.}

The Recognition and Prevention domain includes recommendations for standardized methods of PPH risk prediction, and The Joint Commission now requires use of an evidence-based PPH prediction tool. Postpartum hemorrhage risk predictions can be accomplished via checklist tools completed manually by healthcare providers or via machine-assisted calculations in the form of logistic regression or machine learning populated by automated electronic health record data. The latter examples of machine-assisted calculations of PPH risk are a form of artificial intelligence.

However, it is unknown whether different levels of AI are perceived by customers as features increasing humanness and, subsequently, leading to higher functional, monetary, social, or emotional value. Through an experimental design based on tourism chatbots, the results from structural equation analysis reveal that whereas mechanical AI decreases automated social presence, analytical AI increases perceptions of competence and warmth, and emotional AI improves all humanness cues. The article merges the research streams of service agent design and customers’ perceptions of humanness to guide tourism managers in implementing generative AI agents to increase service value.}

This paper explores the considerable implications of data scarcity for the AI industry, which threatens to restrict its growth and potential, and proposes plausible solutions and perspectives. In addition, this article focuses highly on different ethical considerations: privacy, consent, and non-discrimination principles during AI model developments under limited conditions. Besides, innovative technologies are investigated through the paper in aspects that need implementation by incorporating transfer learning, few-shot learning, and data augmentation to adapt models so they could fit effective use processes in low-resource settings. This thus emphasizes the need for collaborative frameworks and sound methodologies that ensure applicability and fairness, tackling the technical and ethical challenges associated with data scarcity in AI. This article also discusses prospective approaches to dealing with data scarcity, emphasizing the blend of synthetic data and traditional models and the use of advanced machine learning techniques such as transfer learning and few-shot learning. These techniques aim to enhance the flexibility and effectiveness of AI systems across various industries while ensuring sustainable AI technology development amid ongoing data scarcity.}

abstract = {Background
Left bundle branch block (LBBB) is a common electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormality associated with left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD). Although artificial intelligence (AI)–driven ECG analysis shows promise for LVSD screening, it remains unclear if a general AI-ECG model or one tailored for LBBB patients yields better performance.
Objectives
This study evaluates 4 AI-ECG models for detecting LVSD in LBBB patients and examines the impact of training cohort definitions.
Methods
We developed 4 models using 364,845 ECGs from 4 hospitals: 1) a general AI-ECG model; 2) a model trained on automatically extracted LBBB cases; 3) a model trained on a well-curated single-center LBBB data set with expert review; and 4) a hybrid model employing transfer learning by fine-tuning the general model with single-center LBBB data. LVSD was defined as an ejection fraction ≤40%. All models were externally validated on 1,334 ECGs from another hospital, with performance assessed by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values.
Results
In external validation, the transfer learning model achieved the highest AUROC (0.903; 95% CI: 0.887-0.918), closely followed by the general model (0.899; 95% CI: 0.883-0.915); the difference was not significant. Models using automated or expert-based LBBB extraction had lower AUROCs (0.879 and 0.841, respectively). The general model demonstrated high sensitivity, whereas the transfer learning model exhibited superior specificity.
Conclusions
Our findings indicate that a broad AI-ECG model reliably detects LVSD in LBBB patients, and transfer learning offers modest improvements without requiring curated LBBB data sets. Evaluating algorithms in representative clinical populations is essential.}

This study investigates whether and how AI Policy Uncertainty (AIPU) drives corporate greenwashing. Using a large panel of Chinese listed firms from 2010–Q1 2025 and a novel text-based index of AIPU, we establish a causal link through a multi-pronged identification strategy that includes Propensity Score Matching (PSM), a multi-period Difference-in-Differences (DID) design, and an Instrumental Variable (IV) analysis. We find robust evidence that AIPU significantly increases corporate greenwashing. Crucially, this effect is attenuated for firms led by CEOs with strong IT backgrounds, who can better navigate technological turbulence. We further unveil the micro-foundations of this effect, showing that AIPU fuels greenwashing through three distinct mediating pathways: splitting managerial attention toward external risks (a cognitive channel), increasing precautionary cash holdings (a financial channel), and directly inhibiting substantive green innovation (a strategic channel). Heterogeneity analysis also shows the effect is more pronounced for non-state-owned enterprises and non-high-tech firms. Our findings reveal an important unintended consequence of technology governance and offer crucial insights for managers, investors, and policymakers.}

As a result of the descriptive analysis, five main themes were identified: critical content production and evaluation, metacognitive skills and self-regulation, ethical thinking and evaluation, analytical thinking and problem solving, motivation and self-efficacy for the AI-assisted writing process and critical literacy skills. Our findings show that students use AI tools not as a simple copy-paste tool, but as a supportive element to develop their thinking. Students question AI outputs, synthesize them with their own ideas and manage their writing processes more consciously. The findings of our study reveal that AI-assisted writing experiences increase students' ethical awareness of originality, academic honesty and creativity, improve their systematic thinking skills in complex writing tasks, and increase their motivation to write. However, the lack of any study at preschool level, the limited number of studies at primary school level, and the scarcity of qualitative studies indicate that more research is needed in this field.}

This approach has become increasingly important in synthetic biology because it allows for quick testing of ideas, running many experiments simultaneously, and maintaining tight control over reaction conditions. The main challenge has been figuring out how to optimize these systems, since there are so many variables that interact in unpredictable ways. Artificial intelligence (AI), including machine learning, deep learning, and generative models, has begun to tackle this problem by helping predict experimental outcomes, design new proteins, and find better reaction conditions. The discovery of antimicrobial peptides through deep learning and cell-free protein synthesis, along with a 34-fold increase in protein yield through buffer optimization guided by active learning, are some of the major advancements made possible. The use of Bayesian optimization and neural networks has helped to streamline metabolic pathway designing, enzyme engineering as well as yield prediction, which in turn has diversified the use of AI-driven approaches in biomanufacturing, pharmaceuticals, and diagnostics. In spite of hurdles like data requirements, model transferability, and scalability, the compatibility of AI and cell-free systems gives adequate probabilities of innovations like digital twins and self-driven biomanufacturing units. This chapter explores the integration of AI with cell-free systems, focusing on recent advances, industrial applications, and ending with future directions for synthetic biology.}

This study aims to determine the efficacy of the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in rewriting orthopaedic trauma hospital patient educational materials to a patient-appropriate reading level.
Materials and methods
35 orthopaedic patient educational articles were identified from three hospital networks with Level 1 Trauma Centers, categorized based on average reading level. They were run through a formatting Python code, and then a secondary code to determine readability metrics outlined in Table 1. The articles were then rewritten via four iterations of Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT) AI language models. Each model was given the same prompt, outlined in Fig. 1, to rewrite the articles to a 6th grade reading level per AMA recommendations. The rewritten articles were checked for accuracy and formatted and scored to determine mean reading level. Additional analysis was run comparing 9 different AI models from 3 different companies, using the same prompt, comparing cost and percent token reduction.
Results
All GPT AI models lowered the mean combined grade level (Table 2). Fig. 2 compares each GPT model's output to the original articles reading grade level. The oldest model (GPT-3.5-Turbo) was the least consistent and least effective. GPT-4o-Mini and GPT-4o were the most effective and consistent regardless of original article difficulty. Table 3 outlines the cost of running all 35 articles through each GPT model. The most accurate model (GPT-4o) was only $0.61; however, there was only a 0.421 % increase in effectiveness comparing GPT-4o vs. GPT-4o-Mini, at a 175.38 % increase in cost. All GPT rewritten articles were screened for accuracy and determined to have no falsified information or medical inaccuracies. Expanded analysis across 9 AI models is demonstrated in Fig. 4. Fig. 5 compares cost and percent token reduction.
Conclusion
AI is a viable option for reducing the reading difficulty of patient educational materials while maintaining accuracy. Of the models included for analysis, GPT-4o-Mini appears to be the most efficient language model when considering effectiveness, cost, and maintenance of the information included in the original articles.}

abstract = {BACKGROUND
Within public online forums, patients often seek reassurance and guidance from the community regarding postoperative symptoms and expectations, and when to seek medical assistance. Others are using artificial intelligence in the form of online search engines or chatbots such as ChatGPT or Perplexity. Artificial intelligence chatbot assistants have been growing in popularity; however, clinicians may be hesitant to use them because of concerns about accuracy. The online networking service for medical professionals, Doximity, has expanded its resources to include a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act–compliant artificial intelligence writing assistant, Doximity GPT, designed to reduce the administrative burden on clinicians. Health professionals learn using a “medical model,” which greatly differs from the “health belief model” that laypeople learn through. This mismatch in learning perspectives likely contributes to a communication mismatch even during digital clinician–patient encounters, especially in patients with limited health literacy during the perioperative period when complications may arise.
OBJECTIVE
This study aimed to evaluate the ability of artificial intelligence chatbot assistants (Doximity GPT, Perplexity, and ChatGPT) to generate quality, accurate, and empathetic responses to postoperative patient queries that are also understandable and actionable.
STUDY DESIGN
Responses to 10 postoperative queries sourced from HysterSisters, a public forum for “woman-to-woman hysterectomy support,” were generated using 3 artificial intelligence chatbot assistants (Doximity GPT, Perplexity, and ChatGPT) and a minimally invasive gynecologic surgery fellowship–trained surgeon. Ten physician evaluators compared the blinded responses for quality, accuracy, and empathy. A separate pair of physician evaluators scored the responses for understandability and actionability using the Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool for Printable Materials (PEMAT-P). The final scores were the average of both reviewers’ scores. Analysis of variance was used for pairwise comparison of the evaluator scores between sources. Lastly, the Kruskal–Wallis test was used to analyze Flesch–Kincaid scoring for readability. The Pearson chi-square test was used to demonstrate the difference in reading level among the responses for each source.
RESULTS
Compared with a physician, Doximity GPT and ChatGPT were rated as more empathetic than a minimally invasive gynecologic surgeon, but quality and accuracy were similar across these sources. There was a significant difference between Perplexity and the other response sources, favoring the latter, for quality and accuracy (P<.001). Perplexity and the minimally invasive gynecologic surgeon ranked similarly for empathy. Reading ease was greater for the minimally invasive gynecologic surgeon responses (60.6 [53.5–68.4]; eighth and ninth grade) than for Perplexity (40.0 [28.6–47.2], college) and ChatGPT (35.5 [28.2–42.0], college) (P<.01). There was no significant difference in understandability and actionability, with all sources scored as having good understandability and average actionability.
CONCLUSION
As artificial intelligence chatbot assistants grow in popularity, including integration in the electronic health record, the output’s readability must reflect the general population’s health literacy to be impactful and effective. This analysis serves as a reminder for physicians to be mindful of this mismatch in readability and general health literacy when considering the integration of artificial intelligence chatbot assistants into patient care. The accuracy and consistency of these chatbots may also impact patient outcomes, making screening of utmost importance in this endeavor.}

AI screening tools assist the human reviewer in presenting the most relevant article on top, which could reduce the number of articles that need to be screened on title and abstract and on full text. There was a poor inter-rater reliability to evaluate risk of bias between AI-tools and the human reviewers. A summary table created by AI-tools differs substantially from manually constructed summary tables. This study highlights the potential of AI-tools to support systematic reviews, particularly during screening phases, but not to replace human reviews.}

abstract = {This review focuses on foundational knowledge about artificial intelligence (AI) in hepatology, exploring how AI, including machine learning and deep learning, leverages large-scale clinical data to transform the diagnosis, risk assessment, prognostication, and management of liver diseases. Online resources are described to offer fundamental AI knowledge and essential technical skills and to facilitate clinician participation across the entire AI lifecycle, ensuring they contribute not only as end users but also in development and deployment. Unlike traditional statistical approaches that prioritize interpretable parameters and clinical insight, AI focuses on maximizing predictive accuracy by identifying complex, often non-linear patterns using high-dimensional data, albeit often at the cost of model interpretability. AI is demonstrating clinical utility in liver histopathology and radiological imaging, significantly improving detection accuracy for cirrhosis, clinically significant portal hypertension, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Beyond diagnostics, AI-driven prediction models are emerging to provide personalized risk stratification for the development of liver-related complications and treatment guidance, based on complex data including longitudinal laboratory results, comorbidities, and co-medication use to monitor disease progression and therapy response. The field is rapidly expanding into novel areas such as analyzing patient-reported outcomes, genomic data, and real-time liver function monitoring, offering deeper mechanistic insights alongside clinical tools. Despite the potential to revolutionize hepatology practice and research, successful integration into routine care faces challenges. These include seamless workflow integration with existing electronic health records, establishing clear liability frameworks, and guaranteeing protection of patient privacy. Addressing these hurdles requires collaborative efforts from clinicians, researchers, and regulators to develop best practices and governance. Understanding the transformative capabilities, current applications, emerging frontiers, and essential implementation considerations is crucial for clinicians navigating the evolving AI landscape and responsibly utilizing its power for improved patient outcomes.}

abstract = {Quantum Computing (QC) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have emerged as key technologies in the evolution of Industry 6.0, driving advancements in automation and advanced analytics, and process optimization. Their integration holds the potential to revolutionize sectors such as data science, healthcare, finance, and cybersecurity by enabling faster and more efficient computations through qubits, superposition, and quantum entanglement. However, the lack of structured knowledge regarding specific QC methodologies and applications in AI hinders its optimal implementation and development. Consequently, this study aims to identify the applications and variables associated with QC-AI integration. To this end, a systematic literature review was conducted following the PRISMA 2020 methodology, drawing on studies from Scopus and Web of Science databases. This enabled the analysis of trends, limitations, and opportunities in this technological convergence. This study aims to systematically examine the intersection of quantum computing and artificial intelligence by identifying the key technological features, integration requirements, and sectoral applications that define the current state of the field. The review contributes by mapping existing research, highlighting methodological approaches, and revealing gaps that may guide targeted advancements in hybrid quantum AI systems. The insights generated have the potential to accelerate innovation in high-impact domains such as healthcare, finance, energy, and cybersecurity. The findings indicate that the main advances in QC applied to AI focus on quantum optimization, Quantum Machine Learning (QML), and post-quantum cryptography. Notably, sectors such as energy, healthcare, and finance have shown significant progress in adopting these technologies. For example, in healthcare, QML has been applied to simulate molecular interactions to accelerate drug discovery, and in finance, it enhances predictive models for market behavior. The study concludes that although QC demonstrates substantial potential to enhance AI, its broader adoption remains constrained by reliance on NISQ hardware, the need for effective error correction, and the limited scalability of hybrid quantum classical algorithms. Addressing these challenges will be essential to establishing QML as a cornerstone of technological innovation and digital transformation. Additionally, this review introduces an integrative framework that categorizes key AI QC convergence dimensions and proposes a classification of application areas based on technical requirements and algorithmic capabilities. These contributions aim to guide future experimental validations and hybrid model development.}

Mixed-method design comprising both the quantitative (survey based analysis) and the qualitative (far-reaching theoretical framework and case studies review) methodologies was used in the current study. A structured survey was administered to collect data on the AI pattern, efficacy, and frequency of usage among 181 health sciences students. Case studies in practice were also used to serve as evidence of AI's role in medical training: from clinician-initiated simulations to AI-powered assessment tools. The data analysis approaches included descriptive statistics, correlation heat maps, and comparative analysis between AI-assisted teaching and standard teaching. It is concluded that such engagement of the use of AI makes for engagement and deep learning but requires strong institution-wide foundations and ethical frameworks, and measures of growth against institutional preparedness and of having a very rich ethical framework for risk management are still lacking. Hence, the study recommends that balancing technology with ethics would be needed in AI integration and proposes future studies to address gaps in teacher training, institution preparedness, and ethical consideration.}

In the 2010’s, the advent of AlexNet, coupled with plummeting storage and GPU costs, open-source development environments and the marketing of affordable, high throughput digital slide scanners accelerated progress and interest in digital pathology AI/ML applications. While the widespread adoption of large-scale consortium level datasets (e.g., The Cancer Genome Atlas) spurred the development of AI/ML methods for surgical pathology, large-scale collection, and algorithmic modeling of cytology specimens has lagged behind due to the varied nature of cytology preparations and assessment. However, increasing attention has been paid to cytopathology with a commensurate increase in publications and commercial applications in this area. Still, the applications of AI/ML to cytopathology and the herculean effort to implement fully digital pathology services remain in its nascent stages.

CNS cancers are complex, difficult-to-treat malignancies that remain insufficiently understood and mostly incurable, despite decades of research efforts. Artificial intelligence (AI) is poised to reshape neuro-oncological practice and research, driving advances in medical image analysis, neuro–molecular–genetic characterisation, biomarker discovery, therapeutic target identification, tailored management strategies, and neurorehabilitation. This Review examines key opportunities and challenges associated with AI applications along the neuro-oncological care trajectory. We highlight emerging trends in foundation models, biophysical modelling, synthetic data, and drug development and discuss regulatory, operational, and ethical hurdles across data, translation, and implementation gaps. Near-term clinical translation depends on scaling validated AI solutions for well defined clinical tasks. In contrast, more experimental AI solutions offer broader potential but require technical refinement and resolution of data and regulatory challenges. Addressing both general and neuro-oncology-specific issues is essential to unlock the full potential of AI and ensure its responsible, effective, and needs-based integration into neuro-oncological practice.}

Background
Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, has expanded across various fields, including medical education and professional applications. However, the extent to which AI is utilized in writing personal statements (PSs) for adult reconstruction fellowship applications remains unclear. This study aimed to analyze the prevalence of AI-generated text in PSs submitted to our institution before and after the release of ChatGPT.
Methods
We retrospectively reviewed PSs submitted to our institution’s adult reconstruction fellowship from 2021 to 2025. The PSs were divided into two cohorts: Pre-PS (2021 to 2022) and Post-PS (2024 to 2025). The PSs from 2023 were excluded due to uncertainty in AI adoption. All PSs were analyzed using GPTZero, an AI detection software, to determine the proportion of AI-generated versus human-generated text. Descriptive statistics and comparative analyses were conducted.
Results
A total of 421 PSs were analyzed. The Pre-PS cohort had an average GPTZero score of 99.5% (SD 1.9) human, 0.4% (SD 0.8) AI, and 0.1% (SD 1.8) mixed, while the Post-PS cohort had scores of 83.8% (SD 29.9) human, 15.1% (SD 28.9) AI, and 1.1% mixed (SD 5.2) (P < 0.001). The AI-generated text was significantly more prevalent in the Post-PS cohort compared to the Pre-PS cohort. Additionally, international medical graduates (IMGs) and applicants from non-U.S. residencies demonstrated a higher proportion of AI-generated text in their PSs compared to U.S. applicants (P < 0.001).
Conclusion
The use of AI in PS writing has increased significantly since the release of ChatGPT. Given the role of PSs in candidate selection, these findings highlight the need for transparency, standardized guidelines regarding AI-assisted writing, and re-evaluation of the importance placed on personal statements in candidate selection. Further research should expand to other subspecialties and institutions to assess the broader implications of AI in postgraduate medical education.}

This study presents a large-scale review of 983 scientific publications on artificial intelligence-based photovoltaic fault detection, using a novel methodology called Topic-tSNE Fusion. This approach integrates topic modeling, dimensionality reduction, and expert analysis to extract and visualize dominant research themes. Four key machine learning paradigms are identified: supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and reinforcement learning. Among them, supervised methods, particularly neural networks and support vector machines, are the most frequently applied, showing accuracies above 95% in controlled conditions. The analysis also reveals growing use of semi-supervised and hybrid approaches to overcome data scarcity. Commonly monitored variables include irradiance, voltage, and current, while the most studied faults are shading, open-circuit, and degradation. Several open-access datasets supporting fault diagnosis research are catalogued. Overall, the proposed method enables a more objective and scalable review process and uncovers emerging trends, such as the shift toward lightweight artificial intelligence for edge deployment and frugal diagnostic architectures.

abstract = {AI technologies offer unique capabilities that enhance collaboration and creativity among students by providing novel insights, generating diverse perspectives, and triggering the development of innovative thinking as a sub-competency of the mega-competency of complex thinking. Regarding entrepreneurial skills development, applying AI-powered tools, such as natural language processing on digital educational platforms, allows students to engage in dynamic ideation processes for entrepreneurial projects with social, technological, and scientific approaches. This article explores the application of artificial intelligence (AI) as a valuable resource for fostering creative idea generation within co-creation strategies for university students. In a mixed-method analysis, we obtained valuable information regarding engagement through co-creation approaches. This paper describes the early implementation stages of the introductory course in technological entrepreneurship, applying the educational platform OpenEdR4C in a hybrid workshop with a group of 20 students in a public higher education institution in central Mexico, this being the first group of >900 people reached during 2024. The findings show that (a) the students are prone to use and explore AI tools in a natural and immediate manner, (b) interdisciplinary collaboration was effectively promoted through co-creation strategies, and (c) training the tool is crucial to keep engagement and ideas fluency. This is a contribution to the exploration to open new opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration, experiential learning, and knowledge co-production, ultimately empowering students to develop innovative solutions to complex societal challenges.}
