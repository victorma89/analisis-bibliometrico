But the flourishing communication about AI makes it more difficult to understand what AI actually is and what role AI takes in society. From a systems theory perspective, we propose that to understand AI is to understand how societal subsystems deal with AI. To investigate the different constructions of AI we use text mining methods on the discursive structure, the semantics, and their trends over the past 20 years. We compare two subsystems – science and mass media – with getting insights from two databases – OpenAlex and Wikipedia. In science, AI is a computer science topic, consisting of four main strands: computer vision, natural language processing, robotics, and machine learning. AI as a research topic appears as a driver of scientific development that underlies machine learnization. AI as a media and broadcasting topic on Wikipedia is stable and concentrates on science, big technological firms, and science fiction. The respective pages are oriented towards the perspective of everyday life and range from personal assistance systems over sci-fi franchises to philosophical currents. We diagnose a trend from speculation to application in the attention AI receives on Wikipedia. Other systems like polity, law, or social movements do not play (at the moment) an important role in either system. Taken together, the trends point to a peculiar divergence between exaggerated expectations, everyday applications and societal debates about potentials, limits, and challenges.}

To assess educational alignment where these changes, the review follows a two-step approach: first, it draws on academic and policy literature to identify emerging technologies and the associated legal competencies needed to navigate their regulatory impact; second, it then evaluates the extent to which China’s maritime law curricula address these professional requirements. As this review aims to highlight, much scholarly and technical attention has been given to the operational and environmental dimensions of maritime innovation, there remains a professional skills gap – a disconnect between the competences now demanded by industry and those currently taught in legal education. Through comparative curriculum analysis, the paper highlights opportunities for Chinese institutions to proactively leapfrog integrate interdisciplinary legal training in areas such as maritime environmental governance, cybersecurity, and AI liability. The student concludes with a phased proposal for curriculum reform aimed at strengthening China’s legal capacity in the global maritime domain.}

abstract = {Background
The US healthcare system is currently facing significant challenges in quality, affordability, and labor shortages. Artificial intelligence (AI) promises to transform healthcare delivery by making it safer, more effective, less wasteful, and more patient-centered. With more than $30 billion invested in healthcare AI companies in the past three years, the proliferation of AI solutions is expected to bring much-needed relief to the strained healthcare industry. To harness the current enthusiasm for AI in healthcare, we can draw parallels to the adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) under the HITECH Act of 2009. EHR adoption has been widespread and has contributed to significant health information technology spending, but it has also brought unintended consequences, such as clinician burnout, workarounds, and mixed impacts on patient safety and quality measures.
The EHR Era vs. the AI Era: Differences
This article grounds the discussion by first reviewing the key differences between the EHR implementation era that followed the passage of HITECH and the current AI era. The authors identified three characteristics of the AI era that distinguish it from the EHR implementation era: different regulatory and legislative context, diminished capacity of the workforce to absorb new work, and an accelerated pace of change.
Lessons from EHR Implementation to Carry Forward to AI Implementation
Based on the collective experience of the authorship team and published literature on EHR and AI implementation, the authors identified five critical lessons from the EHR implementation era that organizations deploying AI must consider: (1) respect the human element, (2) build strong organizational governance, (3) adapt leadership and culture, (4) ready the workforce, and (5) build for the long term.
Conclusion
By applying these lessons, organizational leaders can realize the potential of AI to improve patient outcomes and transform healthcare delivery.}

However, fully depicting the vast mosaic of concepts and applications in environmental sciences and ecology often entails a substantial workload. New Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools present an attractive option for addressing this challenge but require sufficient validation to match the vigorous standards of a systematic review. This article demonstrates the use of generative AI in the selection of relevant literature as part of a systematic review on indicators of ecosystem condition. We highlight, through the development of an optimal prompt to communicate inclusion and exclusion criteria, the need to describe ecosystem condition as a multidimensional concept whilst also maintaining clarity on what does not meet the criteria of comprehensiveness. We show that, although not completely infallible, the GPT-3.5 model significantly outperforms traditional literature screening processes in terms of speed and efficiency whilst correctly selecting 83 % of relevant literature for review. Our study highlights the importance of precision in prompt design and the setting of query parameters for the AI model and opens the perspective for future work using language models to contextualize complex concepts in the environmental sciences. Future development of this methodology in tandem with the continued evolution of the accessibility and capacity of AI tools presents a great potential to improve evidence synthesis through gains in efficiency and possible scope.}

To evaluate the performance of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based artificial intelligence (AI) in the preoperative prediction of microvascular invasion (MVI) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
Methods
A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science was conducted up to May 2025, following PRISMA guidelines. Studies using MRI-based AI models with histopathologically confirmed MVI were included. Study quality was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tool and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework. Statistical synthesis used bivariate random-effects models.
Results
Twenty-nine studies were included, totaling 2838 internal and 1161 external validation cases. Pooled internal validation showed a sensitivity of 0.81 (95% CI: 0.76–0.85), specificity of 0.82 (95% CI: 0.78–0.85), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) of 19.33 (95% CI: 13.15–28.42), and area under the curve (AUC) of 0.88 (95% CI: 0.85–0.91). External validation yielded a comparable AUC of 0.85. Traditional machine learning methods achieved higher sensitivity than deep learning approaches in both internal and external validation cohorts (both P < 0.05). Studies incorporating both radiomics and clinical features demonstrated superior sensitivity and specificity compared to radiomics-only models (P < 0.01).
Conclusions
MRI-based AI demonstrates high performance for preoperative prediction of MVI in HCC, particularly for MRI-based models that combine multimodal imaging and clinical variables. However, substantial heterogeneity and low GRADE levels may affect the strength of the evidence, highlighting the need for methodological standardization and multicenter prospective validation to ensure clinical applicability.}

abstract = {The gut microbiome is involved in human health and disease, and its comprehensive understanding is necessary to exploit it as a diagnostic or therapeutic tool. Multi-omics approaches, including metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, metabolomics, and metaproteomics, enable depiction of the gut microbial ecosystem’s complexity. However, these tools generate a large data stream in which integration is needed to produce clinically useful readouts, but, in turn, might be difficult to carry out with conventional statistical methods. Artificial intelligence and machine learning have been increasingly applied to multi-omics datasets in several conditions associated with microbiome disruption, from chronic disorders to cancer. Such tools have potential for clinical implementation, including discovery of microbial biomarkers for disease classification or prediction, prediction of response to specific treatments, and fine-tuning of microbiome-modulating therapies. The state of the art, potential, and limits, of artificial intelligence and machine learning in the multi-omics approach to gut microbiome are discussed.}

abstract = {Introduction
Large language models like Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (ChatGPT) are increasingly used in academic writing. Faculty may consider use of artificial intelligence (AI)–generated responses a form of cheating. We sought to determine whether general surgery residency faculty could detect AI versus human-written responses to a text prompt; hypothesizing that faculty would not be able to reliably differentiate AI versus human-written responses.
Methods
Ten essays were generated using a text prompt, “Tell us in 1-2 paragraphs why you are considering the University of Rochester for General Surgery residency” (Current trainees: n = 5, ChatGPT: n = 5). Ten blinded faculty reviewers rated essays (ten-point Likert scale) on the following criteria: desire to interview, relevance to the general surgery residency, overall impression, and AI- or human-generated; with scores and identification error rates compared between the groups.
Results
There were no differences between groups for %total points (ChatGPT 66.0 ± 13.5%, human 70.0 ± 23.0%, P = 0.508) or identification error rates (ChatGPT 40.0 ± 35.0%, human 20.0 ± 30.0%, P = 0.175). Except for one, all essays were identified incorrectly by at least two reviewers. Essays identified as human-generated received higher overall impression scores (area under the curve: 0.82 ± 0.04, P < 0.01).
Conclusions
Whether use of AI tools for academic purposes should constitute academic dishonesty is controversial. We demonstrate that human and AI-generated essays are similar in quality, but there is bias against presumed AI-generated essays. Faculty are not able to reliably differentiate human from AI-generated essays, thus bias may be misdirected. AI-tools are becoming ubiquitous and their use is not easily detected. Faculty must expect these tools to play increasing roles in medical education.}

However, the interplay of AI and teacher professionalism has gained scant attention among researchers. To address the gap, this study employed a qualitative research design to examine the contribution of AI technologies to English as a foreign language (EFL) teachers' self-directed professional development (SDPD). A sample of 34 Chinese EFL teachers was interviewed individually. The results of manual thematic analysis showed four ways in which AI tools could foster Chinese EFL teachers' SDPD. Specifically, it was frequently declared that by ‘providing access to latest resources and trends’, ‘reducing workload and pressure’, ‘fostering reflection and personalized instruction’, and ‘enhancing enthusiasm and novelty in teaching’, AI technologies contributed to EFL teachers' passion for SDPD. A comprehensive discussion of the findings and implications for EFL teachers and teacher educators is presented to augment their AI literacy and passion for involving in and devising AI-mediated SDPD practices in L2 settings.}

The urgency for AI literacy is more critical than ever due to the potential unethical use of AI resulting from insufficient knowledge. This issue is particularly crucial for educators because they need to understand and adapt to the impact of AI within educational institutions, with some needing to use and become literate in AI, given that students now have increased access to public AI tools. This research presents a multi-phase study to address the issue of bridging the knowledge gap in AI by conducting co-creation with innovation champions, illustrated by a case of Generative AI innovation in a K-12 school. Using action design research, we engaged experienced teachers who are experts in pedagogical innovation to co-create a generative AI-enhanced platform at a leading K-12 education institution known for its pedagogical innovation in Australia. The findings reveal that champions enhance their knowledge through their subject-matter expertise, organizational knowledge, and AI knowledge gained through external exposure and experience. The study also highlights the key elements that facilitate a cross-domain knowledge exchange platform, enabling champions to be exposed to and experience AI technological learning, leading to shifts in their understanding and perception of AI. The initially unaware and sceptical champions become more aware and capable of articulating more technical AI knowledge rooted in a shared value. This research demonstrates how co-creation serves as a pathway for learning AI, particularly among K-12 teachers who are innovation champions. It underscores the impact of experiential and organizational learning on AI collaborative learning and behavioral intentions. Additionally, the study presents that aligning organizational and personal visions and values can influence perceptions about AI technologies, enhancing the discourse on AI and education innovation.}

A new deep reinforcement learning-based (DRL-based) bandwidth allocation system for real-time, dynamic management of 5G radio access networks is proposed in this paper. Unlike rule-based and static strategies, the proposed system dynamically updates itself according to shifting network conditions such as traffic load and channel conditions to maximize the achievable throughput, fairness, and compliance with QoS requirements. By using extensive simulations mimicking real-world 5G scenarios, the proposed DRL model outperforms current baselines like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), linear regression, round-robin, and greedy algorithms. It attains 90%–95% of the maximum theoretical achievable throughput and nearly twice the conventional equal allocation. It is also shown to react well under delay and reliability constraints, outperforming round-robin (hindered by excessive delay and packet loss) and proving to be more efficient than greedy approaches. In conclusion, the efficiency of DRL in optimizing the allocation of bandwidth is highlighted, and its potential to realize self-optimizing, Artificial Intelligence-assisted (AI-assisted) resource management in 5G as well as upcoming 6G networks is revealed.}

However, most existing studies estimate a singular land value over large areas, lacking the fine-grained details for urban management. This study therefore develops a RAHGV (relative-to-absolute hybrid generative valuation) framework for regional land valuation, which combines a hybrid learning strategy with deep generative modeling to produce high-resolution, spatially continuous land value distribution across extensive urban areas. In a case study of New York City (NYC), the RAHGV model outperforms typical one-step models by differentiating between local land variations and broader regional tendencies. Its bi-attention bottleneck significantly improves model performance, reducing MAE (Mean Absolute Error) by 45.75% and MSE (Mean Squared Error) by 69.86% compared to conventional deep generative methods. Local physical infrastructure and mixed land-use patterns primarily influence micro-scale land values, while community amenities and economic vibrancy drive macro-scale values. The findings highlight the potential of the RAHGV framework as a powerful tool for promoting sustainable urban development by delivering high-resolution, data-driven insights that support informed decision-making in rapidly evolving urban environments.}

CyberAIBot gradually detects, learns, and adapts to different cyber attacks. In detail, CyberAIBot uses Deep Learning (DL) technical clusters trained in specific attacks and a Deep Learning (DL) management cluster specialises in taking management decisions rather than technical evaluations. This management cluster supervises conflicting classifications from the deep learning technical clusters. CyberAIbot is trained against several datasets and its performance is evaluated between two classification algorithms, the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). The SVM DL clusters learn faster (average 15x) although the LSTM DL clusters perform better (average 30%). The LSTM DL management cluster performs better than the SVM DL management cluster although it recognises fewer traffic types.

Children's voice and communication abilities evolve with age, necessitating tailored protocols for accurate analysis. Distinct vocal properties and communication styles across developmental stages require specific tasks. The absence of standardized pediatric protocols impedes reliable voice data collection, limits robust acoustic measurements, and hinders AI-driven voice research. This study aims to develop age-specific voice data collection protocols, creating a pediatric voice database to advance research and enhance AI applications.
Methods
Protocols were developed iteratively over six months through a multidisciplinary, multi-institutional team involving speech-language pathologists and otolaryngologists. A comprehensive literature review was completed. Emphasis was placed on designing protocols capable of generating high-quality, consistent data for AI modeling while minimizing measurement variability.
Results
Four developmentally appropriate protocols were created for children aged 2 to <4 years, 4 to <6 years, 6 to <10 years, and 10+ years respectively. Each protocol targeted key acoustic parameters while aligning with the linguistic and cognitive abilities of the respective age group. The iterative design incorporated tasks that engaged children while ensuring clinically robust data collection. Standardized protocols were deployed via a user-friendly iPad application, using child-sized headset microphones at fixed distances from the mouth. The protocols were administered to 100 pediatric patients in an otolaryngology clinic between the ages of 2–18.
Conclusions
The development of age specific protocols aims to standardize the collection of pediatric voice and acoustic sound data, which will serve as a valuable resource for advancing artificial intelligence applications within clinical sciences. Future validation will ensure feasibility, adherence, and reliability of data collection to support AI-driven innovations.}

AI technologies, such as machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), enable the efficient analysis of vast datasets, facilitate faster identification of drug targets, optimization of compounds, and prediction of clinical outcomes. This review explores the multifaceted applications of AI across various stages of cancer drug development, from early-stage discovery to clinical trial design, development. In early-stage discovery, AI-driven methods support target identification, virtual screening (VS), and molecular docking, offering precise predictions that streamline the identification of promising compounds. Additionally, AI is instrumental in de novo drug design and lead optimization, where algorithms can generate novel molecular structures and optimize their properties to enhance drug efficacy and safety profiles. Preclinical development benefits from AI's predictive modeling capabilities, particularly in assessing a drug's toxicity through in silico simulations. AI also plays a pivotal role in biomarker discovery, enabling the identification of specific molecular signatures that can inform patient stratification and personalized treatment approaches. In clinical development, AI optimizes trial design by leveraging real-world data (RWD), improving patient selection, and reducing the time required to bring new drugs to market. Despite its transformative potential, challenges remain, including issues related to data quality, model interpretability, and regulatory hurdles. Addressing these limitations is critical for fully realizing AI's potential in cancer drug discovery and development. As AI continues to evolve, its integration with other technologies, such as genomics and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR), holds promise for advancing personalized cancer therapies.

abstract = {As artificial intelligence (AI) continues to advance in sophistication, its integration into the educational domain is becoming an increasingly tangible prospect. A comprehensive analysis is conducted on the growing impact of AI in educational management, assessing the possibility that it could replace the role of the educational director. Through a prospective approach and an exhaustive review of the scientific literature, the study examines how AI can transform the management of educational institutions by optimizing decision-making processes, enhancing administrative efficiency, and personalizing educational pathways through the analysis of large datasets. However, the intrinsic limitations of AI are highlighted, notably its inability to replicate essential human competencies such as empathy, intuition, inspiring leadership, and nuanced understanding of human interactions. Consequently, a hybrid leadership model is proposed, where AI acts as a high-performing assistant for routine tasks, while human educational directors focus on strategic and relational aspects. Thus, although AI offers significant advantages for educational management, it cannot entirely substitute for the indispensable role of the human educational director.}

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasing being deployed across various sectors in society. While bringing progress and promise to scientific discovery, public administration, healthcare, transportation and human well-being generally, artificial intelligence can also exacerbate existing forms of human vulnerabilities and can introduce new vulnerabilities through the interplay of AI inferences, predictions and content that is generated. This underpins the anxiety of policymakers in terms of managing potential harms and vulnerabilities and the harried landscape of governance and regulatory modalities, including through the European Union’s effort to be the first in the world to comprehensively regulate AI. This article examines the adequacy of the existing theories of human vulnerability in countering the challenges posed by artificial intelligence, including through how vulnerability is theorised and addressed within human rights law and within existing legislative efforts such as the EU AI Act. Vulnerability is an element that informs the contours of groups and populations that are protected, for example under non-discrimination law and privacy law. A critical evaluation notes that while human vulnerability is taken into account in governing and regulating AI systems, the vulnerability lens that informs legal responses is one that is particularistic, static and identifiable. In other words, the law demands that vulnerabilities are known in advance in order for meaningful parameters of protection to be designed around them. The individual, as the subject of legal protection, is also expected to be able to identify the harms suffered and therein seek for accountability. However, AI can displace this straightforward framing and the legal certainty that implicitly underpins how vulnerabilities are dealt with under the law. Through data-driven inferential insights of predictive AI systems and content generation enabled by general purpose AI models, novel forms of dynamic, unforeseeable and emergent forms of vulnerability can arise that cannot be adequately encompassed within existing legal responses. Instead, it requires an expansion of not only the types of legal responses offered but also of vulnerability theory itself and the measures of resilience that should be taken to address the exacerbation of existing vulnerabilities and but also of emergent ones. The article offers a re-theorisation of human vulnerability in the age of AI as one informed by the universalist idea of vulnerability theorised by Martha Fineman. A new conceptual framework is offered, through an expanded understanding that sketches out the human condition in this age as one of ‘algorithmic vulnerability.’ It finds support for this new condition through a vector of convergence from the growing vocabularies of harm, the regulatory direction and drawing from scholarship on emerging vulnerabilities. The article proposes the framework of multi-level resilience to account for existing and emerging vulnerabilities. It offers a typology, examining how resilience towards vulnerabilities can be operationalised at the level of the individual, through technological design and within regulatory initiatives and other measures that promote societal resilience. The article also addresses objections to this new framing, namely in terms of how it seemingly results in a problem with no agency, potentially negating fault ascription and blame. Further, it addresses if the re-conception itself falls into the trap of technological determinism and finally, how the universalist notion of vulnerability can seemingly negate human autonomy that is a key feature of human dignity.}

abstract = {Background
In medical education, particularly in anatomy and dermatology, generative artificial intelligence (AI) can be used to create customized illustrations. However, the underrepresentation of darker skin tones in medical textbooks and elsewhere, which serve as training data for AI, poses a significant challenge in ensuring diverse and inclusive educational materials.
Objective
This study aims to evaluate the extent of skin tone diversity in AI-generated medical images and to test whether the representation of skin tones can be improved by modifying AI prompts to better reflect the demographic makeup of the US population.
Methods
In total, 2 standard AI models (Dall-E [OpenAI] and Midjourney [Midjourney Inc]) each generated 100 images of people with psoriasis. In addition, a custom model was developed that incorporated a prompt injection aimed at “forcing” the AI (Dall-E 3) to reflect the skin tone distribution of the US population according to the 2012 American National Election Survey. This custom model generated another set of 100 images. The skin tones in these images were assessed by 3 researchers using the New Immigrant Survey skin tone scale, with the median value representing each image. A chi-square goodness of fit analysis compared the skin tone distributions from each set of images to that of the US population.
Results
The standard AI models (Dalle-3 and Midjourney) demonstrated a significant difference between the expected skin tones of the US population and the observed tones in the generated images (P<.001). Both standard AI models overrepresented lighter skin. Conversely, the custom model with the modified prompt yielded a distribution of skin tones that closely matched the expected demographic representation, showing no significant difference (P=.04).
Conclusions
This study reveals a notable bias in AI-generated medical images, predominantly underrepresenting darker skin tones. This bias can be effectively addressed by modifying AI prompts to incorporate real-life demographic distributions. The findings emphasize the need for conscious efforts in AI development to ensure diverse and representative outputs, particularly in educational and medical contexts. Users of generative AI tools should be aware that these biases exist, and that similar tendencies may also exist in other types of generative AI (eg, large language models) and in other characteristics (eg, sex, gender, culture, and ethnicity). Injecting demographic data into AI prompts may effectively counteract these biases, ensuring a more accurate representation of the general population.}

This study investigates the influence of AI-based technologies on creating safe and respectful work atmospheres, focusing on their role in fostering safety, inclusion, and ethical management practices. Drawing on recent findings, the paper explores the dual nature of AI's effects, from enabling safer workplaces to posing ethical challenges. (1) The study identifies critical dynamics within AI-driven work environments. Through safety-oriented tools,—such as real-time risk monitoring systems,—AI contributes to incident prevention and fosters inclusion. However, its implementation also introduces challenges, particularly regarding privacy concerns and lack of transparency, which may trigger distrust and raise ethical dilemmas among employees. (2) The analysis further emphasizes ethical and operational barriers. To ensure effective integration, organisations must address the psychological impact of automation, ensuring it does not compromise employee morale or workplace cohesion. Transparent implementation practices are essential to avoid unintended negative consequences. (3) Findings reveal opportunities for AI to reshape organisational culture by harmonising operational efficiency with inclusive values. The study underscores the importance of aligning technological innovation with strategies that prioritise ethical governance and employee well-being. To support these insights, the study adopts a bibliographic analysis methodology, reviewing a curated corpus of peer-reviewed publications from the past five years. Sources were selected based on thematic relevance, scientific rigour, and empirical depth. This method enabled the identification of conceptual patterns, gaps in the literature, and key trends regarding the socio-ethical implications of AI in the workplace. These insights offer practical guidelines for organisations implementing AI technologies. By adopting transparent communication, ethical frameworks, and strategies aligned with employee well-being, businesses can leverage AI to create safer and more inclusive environments. This research underscores the importance of designing policies that balance technological advancement with respect for employee rights and privacy.}

While previous research has examined digital servitization and smart technologies, a gap remains in understanding how Artificial Intelligence (AI) specifically supports various types of digital servitization across both back-office and front-office activities. This study addresses this gap by investigating how AI enhances digital servitization through six case studies of companies implementing AI-driven servitized solutions. Adopting a capability theoretical perspective, we analyze the application of AI in both back-office and front-office activities for the delivery of base, intermediate, and advanced services. Our findings reveal that AI's role varies by service type, affecting customer interactions and operational tasks differently. We present a theoretical framework with five propositions that elucidate how AI capabilities enhance digital servitization. This framework gives scholars a refined understanding of AI's roles beyond the generalized black box approach and offers practitioners practical insights on leveraging AI for digital transformation.}

Intensive care units (ICUs) are at the forefront of this movement, given their unique combination of high data density, decision-making under uncertainty, and the vulnerability of critically ill patients. Yet despite the abundance of proof-of-concept studies, the clinical translation of AI tools remains strikingly limited, with fewer than 2 % of published algorithms prospectively evaluated in real-world ICU settings. In this editorial, we discuss the roadmap proposed by Workum et al., which outlines a progressive, risk-aligned framework for the integration of AI in critical care. Beyond model performance, the authors emphasize fundamental values such as fairness, explainability, and accountability, while highlighting the practical challenges of data interoperability, infrastructure, governance, and liability. Their work reminds us that AI adoption is not primarily hindered by algorithms themselves but by the surrounding ecosystem of data quality, regulatory clarity, and clinician trust. We argue that the true promise of AI in the ICU lies not in rapid technological breakthroughs but in careful, evidence-based, and human-centered implementation. Whether these systems will ultimately improve patient-centered outcomes remains uncertain. The roadmap by Workum et al. should therefore be read as a call for cautious progress: to begin with low-risk applications, to invest in infrastructure and interdisciplinary collaboration, and to rigorously evaluate clinical benefit before moving toward high-stakes medical decision support.}

Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming healthcare education; however, its integration into pharmacy curricula requires further exploration. This study aimed to explore the acceptance of AI-based technology in pharmacy education through the extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) framework and identify opportunities for responsible integration via improved AI literacy.
Methods
A qualitative study was conducted at the School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Ulster University, Northern Ireland, United Kingdom, in April 2025. Eight MPharm students were recruited through purposive sampling, with two participants from each of the four academic years (Years 1–4) to ensure representation of developmental perspectives. Informed by the extended UTAUT framework, semi-structured interviews were conducted via Microsoft Teams. Thematic analysis was conducted using Braun and Clarke's six-phase approach, with data management performed using NVivo 13.
Results
Four major themes emerged from the analysis: (1) Current Understanding and Experience with AI Tools, (2) Perceived Benefits and Opportunities, (3) Challenges and Concerns, and (4) Recommendations for Responsible AI Integration. Students demonstrated a developmental progression in AI use, from basic concept clarification in the first year to complex clinical reasoning applications in senior years. Students primarily discovered AI tools through informal networks rather than formal academic channels. Key benefits included immediate conceptual clarification across multidisciplinary subjects, enhanced academic efficiency, and support for clinical preparation through simulated patient interactions. However, concerns were expressed regarding regional context limitations, accuracy and reliability issues, potential impacts on critical thinking development, uncertainties related to academic integrity, and affordability constraints for premium features.
Conclusion

This study aims to compare student-generated nursing care plans with ChatGPT-generated care planning texts for patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy surgery.
Background
Given the increasing significance of technology in nursing education, the integration of AI-driven tools into educational methodologies demonstrates potential for enhancing nursing students' preparation for clinical practice by providing access to more comprehensive and current information sources.
Methods
This descriptive comparative study evaluated 14 nursing care plans developed by nursing students for laparoscopic cholecystectomy patients alongside care plans generated by ChatGPT for identical patient scenarios, using the DISCERN scale as the assessment instrument.
Results
The quality of student-generated care plans was determined to be satisfactory, whereas the quality of ChatGPT-generated texts was assessed as moderate. Both student care plans and ChatGPT-generated texts demonstrated moderate reliability and information quality regarding nursing care. Students exhibited the highest accuracy rate in formulating correct nursing diagnoses (90.22 %), while ChatGPT-generated texts demonstrated superior performance in correctly establishing nursing goals (90.35 %) and developing appropriate nursing interventions (91.07 %).
Conclusions
The findings indicate that while student-generated care plans demonstrated generally acceptable quality, ChatGPT's performance in this domain was moderate, particularly in formulating surgical nursing goals and interventions. Although clinical outcomes were not evaluated in this study, the results suggest that ChatGPT may serve as a valuable supplementary resource for surgical nursing education and care plan development. Further research is warranted to determine its impact on patient care quality and clinical effectiveness.}

This review includes peer-reviewed publications and conference proceedings in English, focusing on clinical studies of human periodontal diseases. Intraoral photographs served as the primary data source, with fluorescent and microscopic dental images excluded. The methodological characteristics and performance metrics of clinical studies reporting on AI models were analysed. Twenty-six studies met the review criteria. Various image acquisition devices were used by the resarchers including professional cameras, intraoral cameras, smartphones, and home-use devices. Ten studies used clinical examinations as reference methods, while 16 used visual examinations. Eight studies involved multiple experts in dataset annotation. Only 9 studies employed multiple intraoral views for their AI models, with the remaining studies focusing solely on the frontal view. Regarding AI tasks, 17 studies used classification, 4 used detection, and 5 used segmentations. Performance metrics varied widely and were assessed at multiple levels. Classification studies showed accuracies ranging from 0.46 to 1.00, detection studies showed accuracies from 0.56 to 0.78, and segmentation studies achieved Intersection over Union (IoU) scores of 0.43 to 0.70. AI models show potential for detecting periodontal disease from intraoral photographs, but their clinical use faces challenges. Future research should focus on improving reporting standards, standardising evaluation metrics, performing external tests, enhancing data quality, and using clinical gold standards as reference methods. Furthermore, efforts should focus on promoting transparency, integrating ethical considerations, minimising misclassification, and advancing the development of explainable and user-friendly AI systems to enhance their clinical applicability and reliability.}

We illustrate the application of our proposal to a time series of Bitcoin prices, which acts as the response variable, along with time series of classical financial prices, which act as explanatory variables. Three main findings emerge from the analysis. First, recurrent neural networks lead to a better performance, in terms of accuracy and robustness, with respect to classic neural networks. Second, the best performing models indicate that Bitcoin prices are affected mostly by their lagged values, and that their explainability, in terms of classical financial assets, is limited. Third, although limited, the contribution of classical assets to Bitcoin price prediction is well captured by recurrent neural networks.}

abstract = {The 26.07 lakh reported cases of Tuberculosis (TB) in 2024 render India's target of eradicating TB under the National Tuberculosis Elimination Programme a distant dream. Nonetheless, by leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI), India can chase the United Nations' 2030 target. A major obstacle impeding India's initiatives is the stigma associated with TB. Although there has always been a stigma associated with TB, it is the socio-cultural underpinnings of TB which are particularly concerning. Beyond deterring patients from seeking medical help, stigma manifests into numerous repercussions-for instance, patients resort to their own problematic solutions which further worsen the disease. In cases where patients do seek medical care, they often fail to repose trust in caregivers, pay lesser attention to doctor's advice and do not turn up for follow-up appointments, thereby increasing the chances of recurrence. Here, AI can be a gamechanger. It can facilitate stigma mitigation and simultaneously provide treatment to the patient without apparent human intervention. With AI-integration, professional medical help can be delivered to patients via mobile Applications. Nonetheless, the burgeoning AI led technological developments have spurred a spectrum of ethical and legal concerns which require a critical examination. The judicious use of AI in healthcare warrants its deployment to augment human expertise rather than to replace or supplant it. In this context, this paper reviews the challenges and prospects of AI use in healthcare sector, particularly emphasizing on TB management and the associated stigma.

Traditional breeding faces challenges such as polyploidy, high level of genomic heterogeneity, and complex gene-trait associations. By combining multi-omics data researchers learn more about the genetic and molecular basis of important agricultural traits. However, statistical methods are often insufficient to address the data complexity. By contrast, AI techniques, such as machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), are emerging as powerful tools to explore complexity. Algorithms such as random forests (RF) and support vector machines (SVM) can support genomic selection (GS) and trait value prediction. Furthermore, DL models such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) and long short-term memory networks (LSTM) dominate high-throughput phenotyping and time series analyses, providing accurate predictions for crop yield, disease resistance, and genotype adaptation. Large language models (LLMs) are able to integrate complex omics data. AI models can analyze large dataset, generated by genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and phenomic applications because algorithms can combine different inputs, such as DNA sequences, gene expression profiles, protein–protein interaction networks, metabolite concentrations, and phenotypic data under specific environmental conditions. The integration of individual models can improve prediction accuracy by reducing resource inputs and automating labor-intensive tasks involved in breeding programs. Some recent AI methods, such as gradient boosting machines (GBMs) and Transformer models, are increasingly being used to improve scalability and accuracy of predictive analytics. This review summarizes major advances in AI applications in agricultural genetics, highlighting the strengths and limitations of different ML and DL models and their role in integrating complex datasets.

abstract = {Background and Objectives
AI has emerged as a transformative force in clinical medicine, changing the diagnosis, treatment, and management of patients. Tools have been derived for working with ML, DL, and NLP algorithms to analyze large complex medical datasets with unprecedented accuracy and speed, thereby improving diagnostic precision, treatment personalization, and patient care outcomes. For example, CNNs have dramatically improved the accuracy of medical imaging diagnoses, and NLP algorithms have greatly helped extract insights from unstructured data, including EHRs. However, there are still numerous challenges that face AI integration into clinical workflows, including data privacy, algorithmic bias, ethical dilemmas, and problems with the interpretability of “black-box” AI models. These barriers have thus far prevented the widespread application of AI in health care, and its possible trends, obstacles, and future implications are necessary to be systematically explored. The purpose of this paper is, therefore, to assess the current trends in AI applications in clinical medicine, identify those obstacles that are hindering adoption, and identify possible future directions. This research hopes to synthesize evidence from other peer-reviewed articles to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the role that AI plays to advance clinical practices, improve patient outcomes, or enhance decision-making.
Methods
A systematic review was done according to the PRISMA guidelines to explore the integration of Artificial Intelligence in clinical medicine, including trends, challenges, and future directions. PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Scopus databases were searched for peer-reviewed articles from 2014 to 2024 with keywords such as “Artificial Intelligence in Medicine,” “AI in Clinical Practice,” “Machine Learning in Healthcare,” and “Ethical Implications of AI in Medicine.” Studies focusing on AI application in diagnostics, treatment planning, and patient care reporting measurable clinical outcomes were included. Non-clinical AI applications and articles published before 2014 were excluded. Selected studies were screened for relevance, and then their quality was critically appraised to synthesize data reliably and rigorously.
Results
This systematic review includes the findings of 8 studies that pointed out the transformational role of AI in clinical medicine. AI tools, such as CNNs, had diagnostic accuracy more than the traditional methods, particularly in radiology and pathology. Predictive models efficiently supported risk stratification, early disease detection, and personalized medicine. Despite these improvements, significant hurdles, including data privacy, algorithmic bias, and resistance from clinicians regarding the “black-box” nature of AI, had yet to be surmounted. XAI has emerged as an attractive solution that offers the promise to enhance interpretability and trust. As a whole, AI appeared promising in enhancing diagnostics, treatment personalization, and clinical workflows by dealing with systemic inefficiencies.
Conclusion
The transformation potential of AI in clinical medicine can transform diagnostics, treatment strategies, and efficiency. Overcoming obstacles such as concerns about data privacy, the danger of algorithmic bias, and difficulties with interpretability may pave the way for broader use and facilitate improvement in patient outcomes while transforming clinical workflows to bring sustainability into healthcare delivery.}

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to propose a comprehensive framework for integrating GenAI into research and development in sensory and consumer science. The framework highlights how GenAI can be applied across the concept, design, and testing phases through an iterative process. The concept phase utilises GenAI to generate research concepts (e.g., proposing ideas such as research questions and hypotheses). The design phase employs GenAI to formulate research designs. During this stage, GenAI assists with creating and validating survey/experimental stimuli and measurement scales. The testing phase applies GenAI to evaluate research ideas and designs by employing “silicon samples,” interactive surveys that enhance engagement and response quality. In the testing phase, GenAI can also analyse unstructured text data, offering more accurate and scalable text analysis than traditional methods, even across diverse languages and cultures. This study also acknowledges potential pitfalls, such as biases in AI outputs, data privacy and security concerns, oversimplification, lack of transparency, and GenAI user misperception.

abstract = {Introduction
Artificial intelligence has permeated all aspects of our existence, and medical imaging has shown the burgeoning use of artificial intelligence in clinical environments. However, there are limited empirical studies on radiography students' use of artificial intelligence for learning and assessment. Therefore, this study aimed to gain an understanding of this phenomenon.
Methods
The study used a qualitative explorative and descriptive research design. Data was obtained through five focus group interviews with purposively sampled undergraduate medical imaging and radiation science students at a single higher education institution in South Africa. Verbatim transcripts of the audio-recorded interviews were analysed thematically.
Results
Three themes and related subthemes were developed: 1) understanding artificial intelligence, 2) experiences with the use of artificial intelligence with the subthemes of the use of artificial intelligence in theoretical and clinical learning and challenges of using artificial intelligence, and 3) incorporation of artificial intelligence in undergraduate medical imaging and radiation sciences education with the subthemes of student education, ethical considerations and responsible use and curriculum integration of artificial intelligence in relation to learning and assessment.
Conclusion
Participants used artificial intelligence for learning and assessment by generating ideas to enhance academic writing, as a learning tool, finding literature, language translation and for enhanced efficiency. Simulation-based artificial intelligence supports students' clinical learning, and artificial intelligence within the clinical departments assists with improved patient outcomes. However, participants expressed concerns about the reliability and ethical implications of artificial intelligence-generated information. To address these concerns, participants suggested integrating artificial intelligence into medical imaging and radiation sciences education, where educators need to educate students on the responsible use of artificial intelligence in learning and consider artificial intelligence in assessments.
Implications for practice
The study findings contribute to understanding medical imaging and radiation sciences students’ use of artificial intelligence and may be used to develop evidence-based strategies for integrating artificial intelligence into the curriculum to enhance medical imaging and radiation sciences education and support students.}

abstract = {Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare, progressive disorder characterized by pulmonary vascular remodeling, increased pulmonary vascular resistance, and ultimately right ventricular failure. Despite therapeutic advances, delayed diagnosis and imprecise risk stratification remain key challenges. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) offer opportunities across the care continuum. This includes early detection from electronic health records, electrocardiography and imaging, automated, standardized interpretation of echocardiography, computed tomography (CT), and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) potentially expediting referral and final diagnosis. Deep learning applied to echocardiography achieves expert-level PAH classification and provides automated right-heart quantification while CT/CMR-based models segment the heart and great vessels, quantify lung disease radiomics, and infer hemodynamics, supporting noninvasive triage and prognostication. In future, remote monitoring with wearables and telemedicine, coupled with AI analytics, promises to enable proactive management and potentially reduce hospitalizations. While early studies are promising, translation to practice requires rigorous external validation, prospective studies, bias auditing and seamless integration into guideline-aligned workflows. Overall, AI stands to augment expert clinical judgement by converting high-dimensional, multimodal data into actionable insights. With careful governance and evidence generation, AI has the potential to shorten time-to-diagnosis, refine risk stratification, and personalize therapy in PAH, ultimately improving outcomes for this high-risk population.}

abstract = {Background and purpose
Tumor hypoxia is linked to lower local control rates and increased distant disease progression during head and neck (HN) radiotherapy. 18F-fluoromisonidazole (18F-FMISO) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging measured hypoxia can aid dose selection for HN patients, but its availability is limited. Hence, we tested the hypothesis that an artificial intelligence (AI) model could synthesize 18F-FMISO-like images from routinely acquired 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET images in order to predict primary tumor or metastatic lymph node hypoxic volumes.
Materials and methods
One hundred and thirty-four (training = 84, validation = 13, testing = 21, additional testing = 16) HN carcinoma patients, treated with chemoradiotherapy between 2011 and 2018 and scanned at treatment baseline with 18F-FDG PET/computed tomography (CT) and 18F-FMISO dynamic PET/CT, were analyzed. A pix2pix-architecture-based generative adversarial network was trained to yield 2D voxel-wise FMISO hypoxia images of target-to-blood ratios (TBRs) directly from the 18F-FDG PET/CT image slices. The hypoxic volume was defined consistent with clinical procedure as the malignant volume with TBR values above 1.2. The AI model hypoxia predictions were compared against scaled 18F-FDG PET values.
Results
The AI model hypoxic volume predictions were well-correlated with 18F-FMISO hypoxic volumes on the held-out test subjects (Pearson correlation testing R = 0.96, additional testing R = 0.91, p < 0.001). Predictions from globally scaled 18F-FDG PET images also produced a significantly correlated but worse prediction.
Conclusion
Voxel-wise prediction of hypoxia for HN cancers from a 2D deep learning model using FDG-PET images as inputs was shown to be feasible. Testing on larger institutional and multi-institutional cohorts is required to establish generalizability.}

abstract = {The main drawback of traditional ecological models is the inability to model local interactions between individuals. As a consequence, it was impossible to mathematically model individual-based mechanisms of direct and indirect competition, which hampers the understanding of ecological dynamics. To overcome this problem, we developed a fully transparent mechanistic analog of the classical Lotka-Volterra phenomenological model based on explicitly explainable artificial intelligence (AI) of the glass-box type. In this paper, on an individual-based model, we present (i) a rigorous mechanism of inverted competitive exclusion where, all else being equal, the weaker species in direct competition defeats the stronger species through indirect exploitative competition and (ii) a rigorous mechanism of coexistence of complete competitors resulting from a combination of accounting for microhabitat regeneration, moderate reproduction, a certain habitat size and boundary conditions. Both presented mechanisms go beyond the classical formulations of the competitive exclusion principle, as in our model two species with different competitiveness compete for a single limiting resource in one homogeneous bounded ecosystem. We have shown that individual-based modeling of direct and indirect competition mechanisms allows for a more detailed understanding of the causal mechanisms of interspecific competition. Such understanding is necessary to refine formulations of the competitive exclusion principle, to search for mechanisms of competitive coexistence, to predict ecosystem behavior, and to develop conservation strategies. Our approach allows us to study discrete systems with fundamentally discrete mathematics, which opens up new opportunities for achieving accuracy, clarity, rigor, and explainability in studies of complex systems.}

Data were based on 37 participants’ experiences with two different types of GenAI tools–a GenAI reviewer and GenAI image generator platforms. The application of the GenAI review tool relied on precision fine-tuning and transparency in AI-human interactions, while the AI image generation tools facilitated the participants’ reflection on their learning experiences and AI's role in education. Students’ interaction with both tools was designed to foster their learning regarding GenAI's strengths and limitations, and their responsible application in educational contexts. The findings revealed that the participants appeared to feel more comfortable using GenAI tools after their course experiences. The results also point to the students’ enhanced ability to understand and critically assess the value of AI applications in education.

abstract = {Objectives
Diabetes remains a major global health challenge in China. Artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated considerable potential in improving diabetes management. This study aimed to assess healthcare providers’ perceptions regarding AI in diabetes care across China.
Methods
A cross-sectional survey was conducted using snowball sampling from November 12 to November 24, 2024. We selected 514 physicians and nurses by a snowball sampling method from healthcare providers across 30 cities or provinces in China. The self-developed questionnaire comprised five sections with 19 questions assessing medical workers’ demographic characteristics, AI-related experience and interest, awareness, attitudes, and concerns regarding AI in diabetes care. Statistical analysis was performed using t-test, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and linear regression.
Results
Among them, 20.0 % and 48.1 % of respondents had participated in AI-related research and training, while 85.4 % expressed moderate to high interest in AI training for diabetes care. Most respondents reported partial awareness of AI in diabetes care, and only 12.6 % exhibited a comprehensive or substantial understanding. Attitudes toward AI in diabetes care were generally positive, with a mean score of 24.50 ± 3.38. Nurses demonstrated significantly higher scores than physicians (P < 0.05). Greater awareness, prior AI training experience, and higher interest in AI training in diabetes care were strongly associated with more positive attitudes (P < 0.05). Key concerns regarding AI included trust issues from AI-clinician inconsistencies (77.2 %), increased workload and clinical workflow disruptions (63.4 %), and incomplete legal and regulatory frameworks (60.3 %). Only 34.2 % of respondents expressed concerns about job displacement, indicating general confidence in their professional roles.
Conclusions
While Chinese healthcare providers show moderate awareness of AI in diabetes care, their attitudes are generally positive, and they are considerably interested in future training. Tailored, role-specific AI training is essential for equitable and effective integration into clinical practice. Additionally, transparent, reliable, ethical AI models must be prioritized to alleviate practitioners’ concerns.}

Physicians are asked to make decisions on a daily basis without complete certainty, whether it is in understanding the patient’s problem, performing the physical examination, interpreting the findings of diagnostic tests, or proposing a management plan. The reasons for this uncertainty are widespread, including the lack of knowledge about the patient, individual physician limitations, and the limited predictive power of objective diagnostic tools. This uncertainty poses significant problems in providing competent patient care. Research efforts and teaching are attempts to reduce uncertainty that have now become inherent to medicine. Despite this, uncertainty is rampant. Artificial intelligence (AI) tools, which are being rapidly developed and integrated into practice, may change the way we navigate uncertainty. In their strongest forms, AI tools may have the ability to improve data collection on diseases, patient beliefs, values, and preferences, thereby allowing more time for physician-patient communication. By using methods not previously considered, these tools hold the potential to reduce the uncertainty in medicine, such as those arising due to the lack of clinical information and provider skill and bias. Despite this possibility, there has been considerable resistance to the implementation of AI tools in medical practice. In this viewpoint article, we discuss the impact of AI on medical uncertainty and discuss practical approaches to teaching the use of AI tools in medical schools and residency training programs, including AI ethics, real-world skills, and technological aptitude.}

abstract = {Background
While artificial intelligence has significantly impacted medicine, the application of large language models (LLMs) in oral and maxillofacial surgery (OMS) remains underexplored.
Purpose
This study aimed to measure and compare the accuracy of 4 leading LLMs on OMS board examination questions and to identify specific areas for improvement.
Study Design, Setting, and Sample
An in-silico cross-sectional study was conducted to evaluate 4 artificial intelligence chatbots on 714 OMS board examination questions.
Predictor Variable
The predictor variable was the LLM used — LLM 1 (Generative Pretrained Transformer 4o [GPT-4o], OpenAI, San Francisco, CA), LLM 2 (Generative Pretrained Transformer 3.5 [GPT-3.5], OpenAI, San Francisco, CA), LLM 3 (Gemini, Google, Mountain View, CA), and LLM 4 (Copilot, Microsoft, Redmond, WA).
Main Outcome Variables
The primary outcome variable was accuracy, defined as the percentage of correct answers provided by each LLM. Secondary outcomes included the LLMs' ability to correct errors on subsequent attempts and their performance across 11 specific OMS subject domains: medicine and anesthesia, dentoalveolar and implant surgery, maxillofacial trauma, maxillofacial infections, maxillofacial pathology, salivary glands, oncology, maxillofacial reconstruction, temporomandibular joint anatomy and pathology, craniofacial and clefts, and orthognathic surgery.
Covariates
No additional covariates were considered.
Analyses
Statistical analysis included one-way ANOVA and post hoc Tukey honest significant difference (HSD) to compare performance across chatbots. χ2 tests were used to assess response consistency and error correction, with statistical significance set at P < .05.
Results
LLM 1 achieved the highest accuracy with an average score of 83.69%, statistically significantly outperforming LLM 3 (66.85%, P = .002), LLM 2 (64.83%, P = .001), and LLM 4 (62.18%, P < .001). Across the 11 OMS subject domains, LLM 1 consistently had the highest accuracy rates. LLM 1 also corrected 98.2% of errors, while LLM 2 corrected 93.44%, both statistically significantly higher than LLM 4 (29.26%) and LLM 3 (70.71%) (P < .001).
Conclusion and Relevance
LLM 1 (GPT-4o) significantly outperformed other models in both accuracy and error correction, indicating its strong potential as a tool for enhancing OMS education. However, the variability in performance across different domains highlights the need for ongoing refinement and continued evaluation to integrate these LLMs more effectively into the OMS field.}

abstract = {Background
Tobacco use remains a significant global health challenge, contributing substantially to preventable morbidity and mortality. Despite established interventions, outcomes vary due to scalability issues, resource constraints, and limited reach.
Objective
To systematically explore current artificial intelligence (AI) applications within tobacco control, highlighting their usefulness, benefits, limitations, and ethical implications.
Method
This scoping review followed the Arksey and O’Malley framework and PRISMA-ScR guidelines. Five major databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, and PsycINFO) were searched for articles published between January 2010 and March 2025. From 1,172 initial records, 57 studies met inclusion criteria after screening.
Results
AI-driven tools, including machine learning and natural language processing, effectively monitor social media for emerging tobacco trends and personalize smoking cessation interventions. Applications were predominantly focused on predictive modelling (using algorithms like XGBoost and SVM to predict e-cigarette use and relapse risk), cessation support (employing chatbots and reinforcement learning to improve accessibility), and social media surveillance (detecting synthetic nicotine promotions and analysing vaping trends). Approximately 22% of studies aligned with WHO FCTC Article 13 (tobacco advertising regulation), while 45% supported Article 14 (cessation services). However, tobacco industry interference remains a critical challenge, with AI technologies exploited to undermine public health initiatives, target vulnerable populations, and manipulate policy discussions. Critical issues including algorithmic bias, privacy concerns, interpretability challenges, and data quality must be addressed to ensure positive impact.

Objectives
Can conversational artificial intelligence (AI) help alleviate orthodontic patients’ general doubts? This study aimed to investigate the performance of conversational AI in answering frequently asked questions (FAQs) from orthodontic patients, with comparison to orthodontists.
Materials and Methods
Thirty FAQs were selected covering the pre-, during-, and postorthodontic treatment stages. Each question was respectively answered by AI (Chat Generative Pretrained Transformer [ChatGPT]-4) and two orthodontists (Ortho. A and Ortho. B), randomly drawn out of a panel. Their responses to the 30 FAQs were ranked by four raters, randomly selected from another panel of orthodontists, resulting in 120 rankings. All the participants were Chinese, and all the questions and answers were conducted in Chinese.
Results
Among the 120 rankings, ChatGPT was ranked first in 61 instances (50.8%), second in 35 instances (29.2%), and third in 24 instances (20.0%). Furthermore, the mean rank of ChatGPT was 1.69 ± 0.79, significantly better than that of Ortho. A (2.23 ± 0.79, P < 0.001) and Ortho. B (2.08 ± 0.79, P < 0.05). No significant difference was found between the two orthodontist groups. Additionally, the Spearman correlation coefficient between the average ranking of ChatGPT and the inter-rater agreement was 0.69 (P < 0.001), indicating a strong positive correlation between the two variables.
Conclusions
Overall, the conversational AI ChatGPT-4 may outperform orthodontists in addressing orthodontic patients’ FAQs, even in a non-English language. In addition, ChatGPT tends to perform better when responding to questions with answers widely accepted among orthodontic professionals, and vice versa.}

abstract = {Products and services labeled as AI-created are perceived differently than identical ones attributed to humans, reflecting the phenomenon of algorithm aversion. This perception gap is partly explained by individuals’ tendency to attribute lower effort and creativity to work produced by AI algorithms. Through two pre-registered experiments, we investigate how individuals evaluate creative content when it is labeled as created by AI, humans, or human-AI collaboration. While previous research has established algorithm aversion across various domains, our findings reveal nuanced patterns in creative contexts. Individuals consistently rate content labeled as AI-authored as less creative and less favorable compared to content labeled as human-authored. This effect is driven by a sequential mediation: perceived effort influences perceived creativity, which in turn shapes overall attitudes. Importantly, content labeled as human-AI collaboration performs significantly better than AI-only content, suggesting a potential mitigation strategy. Our main theoretical contribution is the identification of the machine heuristic (MH), individuals' preexisting beliefs about AI capabilities, as a key moderator. Individuals with stronger MH beliefs attribute more effort to AI-generated work, which positively influences perceptions of creativity along with behavioral intentions. Using Netflix show descriptions as stimuli, we show these effects extend beyond attitudes to impact behavioral outcomes like willingness to watch. These results expand algorithm aversion theory by establishing MH as an important boundary condition and highlighting human-AI collaboration as an effective mitigation approach, offering valuable insights for creative industries integrating AI while maintaining positive perceptions among users.}

Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping infectious disease diagnostics by supporting clinical decision making, optimising laboratory and clinical workflows, and enabling real-time disease surveillance. AI approaches improve pathogen detection, antimicrobial stewardship, and treatment monitoring, enhancing diagnostic accuracy, efficiency, and scalability. The role of AI in combating antimicrobial resistance is particularly significant, enabling rapid pathogen identification and personalised treatment. Despite progress over the past two decades, widespread AI adoption in infectious disease diagnostics faces challenges. In high-income countries, fragmented data ecosystems, incomplete datasets, and algorithmic bias hinder clinical integration. Meanwhile, low-income and middle-income countries contend with limited digital infrastructure, unstandardised data, and financial constraints, exacerbating disparities in diagnostic access. Further barriers include concerns over interoperability, data privacy, cybersecurity, and the regulation of AI implementation. This paper examines the role of AI in infectious disease diagnostics, highlighting both opportunities and limitations. It underscores the need for coordinated investments in digital infrastructure, harmonised data-sharing frameworks, and clinician engagement to support equitable, sustainable adoption. Addressing these challenges will enable health-care systems to harness the potential of AI to improve infectious disease detection, prevention, and management of infectious diseases, thereby strengthening global health resilience.}

abstract = {Purpose
Accurate evaluation of anterior chamber depth (ACD), a major risk factor for angle closure, is clinically important. Although standard techniques provide reliable measurements, they are often labor-intensive, technically demanding, and time-consuming. To address this, we previously developed an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm capable of estimating ACD from slit lamp photographs. This study sought to assess the performance of this AI model when applied via the Smart Eye Camera (SEC), a smartphone-compatible slit lamp imaging system, by comparing its estimates to those obtained with anterior segment OCT (AS-OCT) at a separate institution.
Design
An evaluation of diagnostic test.
Participants
Five hundred fifty-six phakic eyes (268 nondilated and 288 dilated eyes) from 329 Asian patients.
Methods
A retrospective analysis was performed on images captured using both the SEC and AS-OCT. Anterior chamber depth values generated by the AI model embedded in the SEC were compared with corresponding measurements obtained using AS-OCT.
Main Outcome Measures
Metrics, including mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), Pearson correlation coefficient, and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), were calculated to evaluate model performance.
Results
The AI algorithm integrated into the SEC demonstrated the capability to estimate the ACD with an MAE of 0.119 ± 0.0949 mm and an MSE of 0.0233 ± 0.0557 mm. A strong correlation was observed between ACD measurements obtained using AS-OCT and those estimated by AI (R = 0.922; 95% confidence interval, 0.908–0.933). The ICC for agreement between AI-estimated and AS-OCT-measured ACD was 0.903, indicating excellent reliability.
Conclusions
Our AI model, embedded within the SEC platform, demonstrated high accuracy in estimating ACD when benchmarked against AS-OCT. Given its portability and user-friendliness, the SEC presents a promising option for accessible ACD screening across diverse clinical environments.

Purpose
This study aims to systematically synthesize the practical applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in patent analysis by constructing a comprehensive matrix that aligns distinct AI techniques with their corresponding analytical tasks. The “AI Technique and Analytical Task” matrix provides a structured framework for understanding how various AI approaches are deployed across different functional objectives within the patent analysis domain.
Design/methodology/approach
This study integrates bibliometric analysis, BERT-based topic modeling, and literature review to explore AI applications in patent analysis. Data were retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection using a dual-focus search strategy targeting AI techniques and patent analysis tasks. A clear distinction was made to exclude studies analyzing AI trends using patent data, retaining only those applying AI methods to patent analytics. With these strategies, 718 relevant publications were selected as the basis for analysis.
Findings
The results reveal exponential growth in AI-powered patent analysis research since the mid-2010s, with Technological Forecasting and Social Change (TFSC), Scientometrics, and World Patent Information (WPI) identified as the leading publication platforms. Geographical analysis shows that China and South Korea have rapidly increased their research output and institutional engagement, while the U.S. maintains a foundational yet less recent presence. With topic modeling technique, this study identified eleven major thematic clusters, spanning tasks such as emerging knowledge discovery, technology forecasting, and opportunity identification. These were integrated into “AI Technique and Analytical Task” matrix, which systematically maps the relationships between AI methods (such as pretrained language models, convolutional neural networks, semantic analysis, and topic modeling) and their practical implementations. Among these, patent classification and nature language processing (NLP) emerged as the most impactful applications, underscoring AI's vital role in enabling scalable, data-driven approaches to managing complex patent information.
Originality
This study presents a novel integration of multi-layered literature retrieval strategies, bibliometric analysis, BERT-based topic modeling, and an AI technique-to-analytical task matrix to construct a systematic and structured knowledge framework. This integrative approach not only delineates the interdisciplinary evolution of AI applications in patent analysis but also provides strategic guidance for future research, particularly in advancing empirical validation, informing policy applications, and promoting global inclusivity in this emerging field.}

Therefore, we applied the YOLOv7 model in this study; however, we encountered challenges including decreased accuracy with complex defect shapes and complications from data augmentation during pre-training. To solve these problems, we additionally applied the enhanced super-resolution generative adversarial network for higher resolution and a Sobel noise-filtering algorithm to enhance the defect detection accuracy. And we evaluated our system by comparing it with a confidence score. This underscores the effectiveness of the approach in enhancing the defect detection capabilities. Therefore, this defect-monitoring system should be designed to preemptively identify internal structure deformations and enhance SFR safety and maintenance practices.}

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a leading cause of dementia worldwide, characterized by heterogeneous neuropathological changes and progressive cognitive decline. Despite the numerous studies, there are still no effective treatments beyond those that aim to slow progression and compensate the impairment. Neuroimaging techniques provide a comprehensive view of brain changes, with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) playing a key role due to its non-invasive nature and wide availability. The T1-weighted MRI sequence is frequently used due to its prevalence in most MRI protocols, generating large datasets, ideal for artificial intelligence (AI) applications. AI, particularly machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques, has been increasingly utilized to model these datasets and classify individuals along the AD continuum. This systematic review evaluates studies using AI to classify more than two stages of AD based on T1-weighted MRI data. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are the most widely applied, achieving an average classification accuracy of 85.93 % (range: 51.80–100 %; median: 87.70 %). These good results are due to CNNs' ability to extract hierarchical features directly from raw imaging data, reducing the need for extensive preprocessing. Non-convolutional neural networks and traditional ML approaches also demonstrated strong performance, with mean accuracies of 82.50 % (range: 57.61–99.38 %; median: 86.67 %) and 84.22 % (range: 33–99.10 %; median: 87.75 %), respectively, underscoring importance of input data selection. Despite promising outcomes, challenges remain, including methodological heterogeneity, overfitting risks, and a reliance on the ADNI database, which limits dataset diversity. Addressing these limitations is critical to advancing AI's clinical application for early detection, improved classification, and enhanced patient outcomes.}

Nanotechnology, along with artificial intelligence may improve cancer theranostics. Over the decade, advancements in nanotechnology where various tools spanning from nanodiagnostics to real-time monitoring to targeted drug delivery were introduced to improve treatment outcomes. Yet, interpatient variability, tumor microenvironment, and disease progression dynamics hinder their applicability and demand for further research in these technologies. This is where AI could serve as the brain to nanotechnology's brawn. Advanced AI tools utilize machine and deep learning algorithms to analyze and interpret vast datasets, and complex biomarkers improve the accuracy of diagnosis and customize treatment plans. AI tools can predict drug interactions with target sites, and carrier nanomaterials and optimize nanomedicines to enhance their targetability, drug delivery, therapeutic effect, and minimize toxicity.

abstract = {Background
Blood and plasma volume calculations are a daily part of practice for many Transfusion Medicine and Apheresis practitioners. Though many formulas exist, each facility may have their own modifications to consider. ChatGPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) provides a new and exciting pathway for those with no programming experience to create personalized programs to meet the demands of daily practice. Additionally, this pathway creates computer programs that provide accurate and reproducible outputs. Herein, we aimed to create a step-by-step process for clinicians to create customized computer programs for use in everyday practice.
Methods
We created a process of inputs to ChatGPT-40, which generated computer programming code. This code was copied and pasted into Notepad (and saved as a Python file) and Google Colaboratory to verify functionality. We validated the durability of our process by repeating it over a 5-day timeframe and by recruiting volunteers to reproduce our outputs using the suggested process.
Results
Computer code generated by ChatGPT-40 in response to our common language inputs was accurate and durable over time. The code was fully functional in both Python and Colaboratory. Volunteers reproduced our process and outputs with minimal assistance.
Conclusion
We analyzed the practical application of ChatGPT-40 and artificial intelligence (AI) to perform daily calculations encountered in Transfusion Medicine. Our results provide a proof of concept that people with no programming experience can create customizable solutions for their own facilities. Our future work will expand to the creation of comprehensive and customizable websites designed for each individual user.}
