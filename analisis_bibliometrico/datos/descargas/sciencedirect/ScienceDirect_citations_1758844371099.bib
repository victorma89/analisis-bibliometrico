abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming a crucial issue for society. But the flourishing communication about AI makes it more difficult to understand what AI actually is and what role AI takes in society. From a systems theory perspective, we propose that to understand AI is to understand how societal subsystems deal with AI. To investigate the different constructions of AI we use text mining methods on the discursive structure, the semantics, and their trends over the past 20 years. We compare two subsystems – science and mass media – with getting insights from two databases – OpenAlex and Wikipedia. In science, AI is a computer science topic, consisting of four main strands: computer vision, natural language processing, robotics, and machine learning. AI as a research topic appears as a driver of scientific development that underlies machine learnization. AI as a media and broadcasting topic on Wikipedia is stable and concentrates on science, big technological firms, and science fiction. The respective pages are oriented towards the perspective of everyday life and range from personal assistance systems over sci-fi franchises to philosophical currents. We diagnose a trend from speculation to application in the attention AI receives on Wikipedia. Other systems like polity, law, or social movements do not play (at the moment) an important role in either system. Taken together, the trends point to a peculiar divergence between exaggerated expectations, everyday applications and societal debates about potentials, limits, and challenges.}

Overcrowding and long wait times in emergency departments (EDs) remain global challenges that negatively affect patient outcomes and staff satisfaction. As an emerging technology, artificial intelligence (AI) offers the potential to optimize ED operations and reduce wait times.
Objective
Establish a strategy to evaluate AI modeling as it relates to utilizing AI based strategies for ED flow.
Methods
We searched Embase, MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Scopus for English-language studies published from January 1, 1946, to August 17, 2023, and we will update our search to ensure currency. The ROBINS-I tool assessed study quality, while PROBAST examined the risk of bias and applicability.
Results
Out of 17,569 screened studies, 65 full-text articles were evaluated for eligibility, with 16 quantitative observational studies meeting inclusion criteria. The best-performing algorithms included regression-based methods (n = 2), traditional single-model machine learning (n = 8), neural networks/deep learning (n = 3), natural language processing (n = 1), and ensemble methods (n = 2). None of the studies examined AI’s impact in a real ED setting, though four simulations reported wait-time reductions ranging from 7 to 43.2 minutes.
Conclusions
AI integration in ED is still in its infancy. Our review found no real-world ED implementation studies, and most of the existing research lacked involvement from ED experts. This gap highlights the lack of insight into AI’s practical impact. Future reviews and research must clarify these dimensions, guiding AI's effective, collaborative adoption in ED workflows.}

abstract = {Background
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are transforming hemostasis and thrombosis care, with applications spanning disease detection, risk assessment, laboratory testing, patient education, personalized medicine, and drug development. This narrative review explores AI’s clinical utility and limitations across these 6 domains.
Methods
A comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, and Scopus (up to February 2025) was conducted using terms related to AI, thrombosis, and hemostasis. Peer-reviewed, English-language studies were included, supplemented by manual and reference screening. Of 84 studies included, 38 focused on risk assessment, 16 on diagnostics, and others on personalized medicine, drug development, and patient engagement.
Results
AI demonstrated high accuracy in diagnosing thrombotic events via imaging and electronic health record analysis, although sensitivity gaps persisted for complex cases. In laboratory settings, AI outperformed manual review in detecting errors (eg, sample mislabeling and clotted specimens). Risk stratification models surpassed traditional scores (eg, CHA2DS2-VASc) in predicting thromboembolism, yet inconsistently performed in cancer-associated thrombosis. Personalized anticoagulation dosing and genetic severity prediction in hemophilia highlighted AI’s precision. Chatbots and adherence tools have enhanced patient education while AI-driven drug discovery identified novel anticoagulants and repurposed existing therapies. Limitations included variable external validation, “black box” interpretability issues, and dataset biases.
Conclusion
AI offers significant promise for improving diagnostics, risk prediction, and individualized therapy in thrombosis and haemostasis. Future integration depends on transparent, validated, and equitable AI systems embedded within clinical workflows.}

A total of 23 articles were identified from the following databases: EBSCOhost ERIC, EBSCOhost PsycInfo, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. Results highlighted the key potentials of being in a romantic relationship with AI companions as: the facilitation of personal growth and well-being, provision of emotional connection and perceived social support, availability of customisation options, ability to form a sexual connection, as well as a possible outlet for users to seek entertainment and stress-relieving companionship. However, the phenomenon also raises concerns, as it may lead to users' over-reliance and susceptibility to manipulation from the chatbot, perceived shame from stigma surrounding romantic-AI companions, risk of personal data misuse, erosion of human relationships, perpetuation of biases, erosion of emotional connection from abrupt system updates and technical glitches, discomfort from uncanny valley effects, or concerns surrounding coercion to respond and early exposure to sexual content. This systematic review synthesises the dual-edged nature of romantic relationships with AI companions, and outlines critical avenues for future research.}

abstract = {High inflation is causing major manufacturing cost increases, making optimizing production lines a priority in Industry 5.0 manufacturing. As a result, there has been a rising interest in reducing these costs by more efficiently optimizing production, maintenance, and quality costs. This can be accomplished in manufacturing systems by integrating production task and maintenance activity scheduling, predictive maintenance, and quality control, with the application of artificial intelligence, information integration, and interoperability techniques. Accordingly, the present paper’s premise is to perform a literature review regarding production, maintenance, and quality integration in manufacturing environments. It aims to answer the main research question: “What are the current state-of-the-art artificial intelligence techniques applied in production/maintenance scheduling, predictive maintenance, and quality control integration?”. To investigate this, a Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)-like methodology is followed to find the most efficient, reliable, and robust artificial intelligence techniques for production, maintenance, and quality optimization in production lines. Results show that Genetic Algorithms, Reinforcement Learning, Artificial Neural Networks, and Random Forests are among the most often used algorithms in the literature. Furthermore, integration between production/maintenance scheduling and predictive maintenance is done primarily through the rescheduling of production plans when a machine failure is detected. In addition, the same system employed for predictive maintenance is often integrated into also predicting product quality. However, while there have been some accomplishments in this field, research that considers full production, maintenance, and quality integration is still lacking, even if there is an increasing trend of research on this topic.}

Here, the authors describe how models of machine learning like random forests, support vector machines (SVM), and artificial neural networks (ANN) can be used to predict degradation efficiency under pH, light intensity, and catalyst loading conditions in particular. Methods like transfer learning improve model generalizability to systems. AI also enables the identification of new photocatalysts and reduces the necessity for large-scale experimental screening. Hybridization of kinetic models like Langmuir-Hinshelwood with ML enables more stringent predictions at realistic, complex conditions. Additional explainability methods like SHAP and Grad-CAM enable a window into model decision-making, which can inform experimental design. Scripting sensors and reinforcement learning can enable AI to dynamically control and monitor photocatalytic reactors in real time and optimize in real time catalyst concentration, flow rate, and light intensity. AI-efficient reactors are energy-saving and cost-effective, and are capable of degrading up to 99 %. Scaling down the system is not feasible because of the complexity of real effluents and limited information.

AI methods reviewed include Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and Computer Vision (CV). Overall, a significantly growing interest in applying AI methods can be observed across all research areas. However, noticeable differences exist between the three topics. While CV and DL techniques are applied to image data in research on the architectural design of facades, research on environmental aspects of facades often uses numerical data with relatively small datasets and classical ML models. Research on facade structure also tends to use image data but also incorporates numerical performance prediction. A major limitation remains a lack of generalizability, which could be addressed by more comprehensive datasets and novel DL techniques. These include concepts such as Physics-Informed Neural Networks, where domain knowledge is integrated into hybrid data-driven models, and multi-modal diffusion models, which offer generative modeling capabilities to support inverse and forward design tasks. The trends and directions outlined in this review suggest that AI will continue to advance facade research and, in line with other domains, has the potential to achieve a level of maturity suitable for adoption beyond academia and into practice.}

This study mapped the editorial policies regarding the use and acknowledgment of artificial intelligence (AI) in dental journals.
Methods
Dental journals indexed in Web of Science were analyzed. Editorial guidelines and instructions for authors and reviewers were assessed. The outcome of interest was whether a journal reported an AI policy. Exposures of interest were Journal Impact Factor (JIF), Journal Citation Indicator (JCI), total number of citations, and percentage of open access content. Associations between journal metrics and the presence of AI policies were assessed using Poisson regression models with robust standard errors. Adjusted models were developed separately for JIF and JCI, including variables with p ≤ 0.2. Significance was set at p ≤ 0.05.
Results
Among the 158 journals analyzed, 70.9 % reported AI policies. Policies targeted authors (100 %), reviewers (88.4 %), and editors (46.4 %). The most common areas addressed were authorship, language review, and writing assistance. Journals in the upper quartiles of JIF and JCI were about twice as likely to report an AI policy compared to those in the lowest quartile. In the adjusted models, no association was found between total citations and AI policy presence, whereas open access percentage showed a negative association. While AI tools are permitted to aid in language refinement, critical tasks were consistently required to remain human-led, with rare exceptions.
Conclusion
AI-related editorial policies were frequent in dental journals, and higher-impact journals were statistically more likely to report such policies.
Clinical significance
Clearer and more standardized AI policies may promote transparency and ethical AI use.}

Children's voice and communication abilities evolve with age, necessitating tailored protocols for accurate analysis. Distinct vocal properties and communication styles across developmental stages require specific tasks. The absence of standardized pediatric protocols impedes reliable voice data collection, limits robust acoustic measurements, and hinders AI-driven voice research. This study aims to develop age-specific voice data collection protocols, creating a pediatric voice database to advance research and enhance AI applications.
Methods
Protocols were developed iteratively over six months through a multidisciplinary, multi-institutional team involving speech-language pathologists and otolaryngologists. A comprehensive literature review was completed. Emphasis was placed on designing protocols capable of generating high-quality, consistent data for AI modeling while minimizing measurement variability.
Results
Four developmentally appropriate protocols were created for children aged 2 to <4 years, 4 to <6 years, 6 to <10 years, and 10+ years respectively. Each protocol targeted key acoustic parameters while aligning with the linguistic and cognitive abilities of the respective age group. The iterative design incorporated tasks that engaged children while ensuring clinically robust data collection. Standardized protocols were deployed via a user-friendly iPad application, using child-sized headset microphones at fixed distances from the mouth. The protocols were administered to 100 pediatric patients in an otolaryngology clinic between the ages of 2–18.
Conclusions
The development of age specific protocols aims to standardize the collection of pediatric voice and acoustic sound data, which will serve as a valuable resource for advancing artificial intelligence applications within clinical sciences. Future validation will ensure feasibility, adherence, and reliability of data collection to support AI-driven innovations.}

In light of advancements in generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), this study explored whether integrating AI chatbots into positive psychology interventions could enhance their efficacy compared to traditional self-administered approaches. Study 1 examined the efficacy of a gratitude intervention delivered through Snapchat's My AI, while Study 2 evaluated a self-affirmation intervention integrated with a customized ChatGPT. Both studies employed within-subject experimental designs. Contrary to our hypotheses, the integration of AI did not yield incremental improvements in gratitude outcomes (Study 1), or self-view outcomes (Study 2) compared to existing non-AI interventions. However, exploratory analyses revealed that the AI-integrated self-affirmation intervention significantly enhanced life satisfaction and medium-arousal positive affect, suggesting potential benefits for selected well-being outcomes. These findings indicate that while AI integration in brief, self-administered positive psychology interventions may enhance certain outcomes, its suitability varies across intervention types.

This study developed an artificial synaptic thin film transistor (TFT) based on a Cs2AgBiBr6/InOx bilayer. The device demonstrated synaptic behavior under optoelectronic hybrid stimulation (largest wavelength ∼520 nm), such as excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC), inhibitory postsynaptic current (IPSC), paired-pulse facilitation (PPF), spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), short-term memory (STM) and long-term memory (LTM). Notably, the “light writing and voltage erasing” characteristics of these devices could be utilized to construct a convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier for the CIFAR-10 dataset, demonstrating noise tolerance close to the human eye. The loss in recognition accuracy was within 1 % when Gaussian white noise and salt pepper noise were added. Furthermore, these devices exhibited great potential in cycle-consistent generative adversarial networks (CycleGAN), with the generated image quality achieving levels of 0.637 and 0.715 in improved perceptual image processing system (IPIPS) and structural similarity index measure (SSIM) evaluation metrics for the zebra dataset, indicating good image quality.

abstract = {Despite significant advancements in highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) remains a global health challenge due to its high mutation rate, drug resistance, and the complexity of treatment optimization. Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative tool in HIV research, offering innovative solutions for predicting viral mutations, optimizing drug discovery and formulation design. However, challenges such as limited access to diverse datasets, ethical concerns, and model interpretability hinder the full potential of AI in HIV research. This review highlights gaps in AI-driven HIV research and explores advancements to address these challenges. AI-driven platforms, such as DeepHIV and geno2pheno, have demonstrated success in forecasting resistance mutations and guiding therapeutic decisions. AI is also revolutionizing drug formulation development by enhancing solubility, bioavailability, and stability, while improving patient adherence through advanced delivery systems. Current applications of AI in HIV mutation prediction, drug discovery, and formulation optimization have highlighted the potential of AI towards HIV management and eradication while addressing gaps in data availability and model transparency. By integrating structural, pharmacological, and clinical data, AI provides a comprehensive framework for rational drug design and personalized treatment strategies. By leveraging AI-driven insights, HIV treatment and prevention can become more personalized, efficient, and sustainable. Future research should focus on overcoming data limitations, enhancing model interpretability, and exploring innovative AI approaches to contribute to the global fight against the HIV epidemic.}

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays a leading role in Industry 4.0 and future Industry 5.0. Concerns about the opacity of today's neural network AI solutions have led to the Explainable AI (XAI) project, which attempts to open the black box of neural networks. While XAI can help to partially interpret and explain the workings of neural networks, it has not changed their original subsymbolic nature and the opaque statistical nature of their workings. Significant uncertainties remain about the safety, reliability, and accountability of modern neural network AI solutions. Here we present a novel AI method that has a fully transparent white-box nature - eXplicitly eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XXAI). XXAI is implemented on deterministic cellular automata whose rules are based on first principles of the problem domain. XXAI overcomes the limitations for a broader application of symbolic AI. The practical value of XXAI lies in its ability to make autonomous, fully transparent decisions due to its multi-component, multi-level, networked, hyper-logical nature. Looking ahead, XXAI has the potential to become a leading strategic partner in the field of neuro-symbolic hybrid AI systems. XXAI is able to systematically validate neural network solutions, ensuring that the required standards of reliability, security and ethics are met throughout the AI lifecycle, from training to deployment. By creating a clear cognitive framework, XXAI will enable the development of advanced autonomous solutions to achieve the human-centric values of the future Industry 5.0. A comprehensive program for the further development of the proposed approach is presented.}

Artificial intelligence–driven intestinal barrier healing assessment provides novel insights into deep healing, facilitating the discovery of novel therapeutic targets. In addition, the automated integration of multi-omics data can enhance patient profiling and personalized management strategies. The future of inflammatory bowel disease care lies in the artificial intelligence–enabled "endo-histo-omics" integrative real-time approach, harmoniously fusing endoscopic, histologic, and molecular data.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly applied in medicine, with growing interest in its potential to improve outcomes in cardiac arrest (CA). However, the scope and characteristics of current AI applications in resuscitation remain unclear.
Methods
This scoping review aims to map the existing literature on AI applications in CA and resuscitation and identify research gaps for further investigation. PRISMA-ScR framework and ILCOR guidelines were followed. A systematic literature search across PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane identified AI applications in resuscitation. Articles were screened and classified by AI methodology, study design, outcomes, and implementation settings. AI-assisted data extraction was manually validated for accuracy.
Results
Out of 4046 records, 197 studies met inclusion criteria. Most were retrospective (90%), with only 16 prospective studies and 2 randomised controlled trials. AI was predominantly applied in prediction of CA, rhythm classification, and post-resuscitation outcome prognostication. Machine learning was the most commonly used method (50% of studies), followed by deep learning and, less frequently, natural language processing. Reported performance was generally high, with AUROC values often exceeding 0.85; however, external validation was rare and real-world implementation limited.
Conclusions
While AI applications in resuscitation demonstrate encouraging performance in prediction and decision support tasks, clear evidence of improved patient outcomes or routine clinical use remains limited. Future research should focus on prospective validation, equity in data sources, explainability, and seamless integration of AI tools into clinical workflows.}

To address this gap, this study developed a scale to multidimensionally measure AI ethical awareness and cultivated students' AI ethical awareness through problem-solving using AI tools within an AI literacy course. A total of 573 Hong Kong secondary and university students participated in a 14-h course. Data was collected through the AI Ethical Awareness Scale (AIEAS) questionnaire and students' self-reflective writings. The AIEAS framework, encompassing three dimensions, was based on the Belmont Report principles of human autonomy, beneficence, and fairness. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) supported this three-factor structure, with nine items retained. Multigroup CFA results demonstrated strong measurement invariance across gender, education level, and programming knowledge. All Cronbach's alpha and omega coefficient values exceeded 0.70, indicating satisfactory internal consistency and fair temporal stability. Furthermore, students' ethical awareness showed a significant improvement following the course intervention. This study not only provides a robust measure for researchers and practitioners to assess students' ethical awareness through behavioural engagement but also demonstrates the necessity of implementing an education course for cultivating ethical awareness through integrating experience and reflection.}

Congenital heart diseases (CHD) are a significant cause of neonatal mortality and morbidity. Detecting these abnormalities during pregnancy increases survival rates, enhances prognosis, and improves pregnancy management and quality of life for the affected families. Foetal echocardiography can be considered an accurate method for detecting CHDs. However, the detection of CHDs can be limited by factors such as the sonographer's skill, expertise and patient specific variables. Using artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to address these challenges, increasing antenatal CHD detection during prenatal care. A scoping review was conducted using Google Scholar, PubMed, and ScienceDirect databases, employing keywords, Boolean operators, and inclusion and exclusion criteria to identify peer-reviewed studies. Thematic mapping and synthesis of the found literature were conducted to review key concepts, research methods and findings.
Key findings
A total of n = 233 articles were identified, after exclusion criteria, the focus was narrowed to n = 7 that met the inclusion criteria. Themes in the literature identified the potential of AI to assist clinicians and trainees, alongside emerging new ethical limitations in ultrasound imaging.
Conclusion
AI-based tools in ultrasound imaging offer great potential in assisting sonographers and doctors with decision-making in CHD diagnosis. However, due to the paucity of data and small sample sizes, further research and technological advancements are needed to improve reliability and integrate AI into routine clinical practice.
Implications for practice
This scoping review identified the reported accuracy and limitations of AI-based tools within foetal cardiac ultrasound imaging. AI has the potential to aid in reducing missed diagnoses, enhance training, and improve pregnancy management. There is a need to understand and address the ethical and legal considerations involved with this new paradigm in imaging.}

In this paper, we revised and expanded upon the TTT; by including a new stage of assessment (i.e. testing simulated conversations) and providing further guidance on the phases of the TTT. First, the CA is tested in a safe environment with simulated clients (with Gen AI), instead of human clients; second, the TTT is conducted with a selected sample of actual users; and third, the TTT is conducted with a large sample of users.

Statement of problem
Despite advances in artificial intelligence (AI), the quality, reliability, and understandability of health-related information provided by chatbots is still a question mark. Furthermore, studies on maxillofacial prosthesis (MP) information from AI chatbots are lacking.
Purpose
The purpose of this study was to assess and compare the reliability, quality, readability, and similarity of responses to MP-related questions generated by 4 different chatbots.
Material and methods
A total of 15 questions were provided by a maxillofacial prosthodontist and from 4 different chatbots (ChatGPT-3.5, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Copilot, and DeepSeek V3). The Reliability Scoring (adapted DISCERN), the Global Quality Scale (GQS), the Flesch Reading Ease Score (FRES), the Flesch-Kincaid Reading Grade Level (FKRGL), and the Similarity Index (iThenticate) were used to evaluate the performance of chatbots. Data were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis test, and the differences between chatbots were determined by the Conover multiple comparison test with Benjamini-Hochberg correction (α=.05).
Results
There were no significant differences between the chatbots' DISCERN scores, except for one question where ChatGPT showed significantly higher reliability than Gemini or Copilot (P=.03). There was no statistically significant difference among AI tools in terms of GQS values (P=.096), FRES values (P=.166), and FKRGL values (P=.247). The similarity rate of Gemini was statistically higher than other AI chatbots (P=.03).
Conclusions
ChatGPT-3.5, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Copilot, and DeepSeek V3 showed good quality responses. All chatbots' responses were difficult for non-professionals to read and understand. Low similarity rates were found for all chatbots except Gemini, indicating originality of their information.}

abstract = {Background
Coronary artery disease (CAD) manifests differently between sexes, with data suggesting females develop more non-calcified plaques that traditional calcium-centric tools may not detect.
Methods
We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 100 individuals with low total atheroma volume (TAV) < 250 mm3 using artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) to assess sex-based differences in coronary plaque composition. Plaque subtypes included calcified, non-calcified, and low-density non-calcified atheroma volumes.
Results
Females had significantly lower total (p = 0.018) and non-calcified plaque (p < 0.001) burden compared to males. Calcified (p = 0.52) and low-density non-calcified (p = 0.16) plaque volumes did not differ significantly. Age was a consistent predictor of plaque volume across most subtypes.
Conclusions
Despite low overall plaque burden, males demonstrated a higher non-calcified plaque burden than females. This finding contrasts with previous literature and underscores the potential of AI-enabled CCTA to detect subclinical coronary disease, particularly in low-risk cohorts. These results support the use of comprehensive plaque profiling in both sexes to improve early risk stratification.}

abstract = {Purpose
Snapchat is a prominent social media site among youth. In April 2023, Snapchat released an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered chatbot that was automatically implemented on all accounts. Given the apparent ease in communicating with this feature, youth may use it as an information source.
Methods
While Snapchat purports to block results for drug keywords, it is unclear the extent to which this type of content is blocked. In August 2024–January 2025, we asked Snapchat AI questions related to delta-8, a derived intoxicating cannabis product that has been rapidly rising in popularity in the United States and has limited regulations. Qualitative responses were independently coded into thematic categories.
Results
The AI prompted individuals to ask follow-up questions, which largely drove the themes. Themes included general information (similarity to delta-9 THC, but with a purported lower potency; relaxing/euphoric effects; legality), use motives (pain relief, anti-nausea, appetite stimulation, anxiety reduction), potential consequences (dry mouth, red eyes, increased heart rate, drowsiness, contaminated products, inaccurate labeling), retail availability, and product recommendations. Responses did not provide supporting citations. While the AI did not block results related to delta-8, it did block results pertaining to “weed” and “THC.”
Discussion
Snapchat AI is a plausible information source about delta-8 THC among youth. No citations were provided to support claims made by the AI, which portrayed delta-8 THC use favorably, as having benefits and low risks from use. Findings have policy implications, including restricting or regulating this type of content—particularly relating to claims without supporting scientific evidence.}

Innovations in deep neural networks (DNNs) and physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) now provide robust tools to tackle longstanding challenges in light scattering engineering, meta-optics, and nonlinear photonics. This review outlines recent progress in leveraging these computational methodologies to enhance device performance across domains such as dynamic light modulation, antenna design, and nonlinear optical phenomena. We systematically survey advancements in AI-driven forward and inverse design strategies, which bypass conventional trial-and-error approaches by embedding physical laws directly into optimization workflows. Furthermore, the integration of AI accelerates electromagnetic simulations and enables precise modelling of complex optical effects, including topological photonic states and nonlinear interactions. A comparative evaluation of algorithmic frameworks highlights their strengths in balancing computational efficiency, multi-objective optimization, and fabrication feasibility. Challenges such as limited interpretability of AI models and data scarcity for unconventional optical modes are critically addressed. Finally, we emphasize future opportunities in scalable multi-physics modelling, adaptive architectures, and practical deployment of AI-optimized photonic devices.

It was found that the binding interfaces in distinctive protein complexes are highly similar. The structural properties underlying different binding interfaces could be further captured by artificial intelligence. In order to test this hypothesis, we broke protein-protein binding interfaces into pairs of interacting fragments. We employed a generative model to encode these interface fragment pairs in a low-dimensional latent space. After training, new conformations of interface fragment pairs were generated. We found that, by only using a small number of interface fragment pairs that were generated by artificial intelligence, we were able to guide the assembly of protein complexes into their native conformations. These results demonstrate that the conformational space of fragment pairs at protein-protein binding interfaces is highly degenerate. Features in this degenerate space can be well characterized by artificial intelligence. In summary, our machine learning method will be potentially useful to search for and predict the conformations of unknown protein-protein interactions.}

In order to counter the lack of perception of AI-based systems, Explainable AI (XAI) aims to increase transparency and human comprehension of black-box AI models. Explainable AI (XAI) also strives to promote transparency and human comprehension of black-box AI models. The explainability problem has been approached using a variety of XAI strategies; however, given the complexity of the search space, it may be tricky for ML developers and data scientists to construct XAI applications and choose the optimal XAI algorithms. This paper provides different frameworks, surveys, operations, and explainability methodologies that are currently available for producing reasoning for predictions from Natural Language Processing models in order to aid developers.

Secondly, the automatic generation of layout design is realized by constantly adjusting the model parameters and network structure. Finally, various AI layout design algorithms are compared, and their effects and performances in layout design generation are analyzed. To verify the layout and composition matching model's performance, traditional layout design methods are selected for comparison (layout, comparison, harmonic composition, etc.). This study involved 20 design students as participants, evaluating them across three dimensions: overall comprehensive assessment, readability of text information, and rationality of visual path using a Likert 7-point scale. The results reveal that the proposed method's evaluation outcomes in these three aspects are 5.95, 5.68, and 5.74, respectively, higher than the traditional layout design methods.

abstract = {Background
Use of artificial intelligence to generate personal statements for residency is currently not permitted but is difficult to monitor. This study sought to evaluate the ability of surgical residency application reviewers to identify artificial intelligence–generated personal statements and to understand perceptions of this practice.
Methods
Three personal statements were generated using ChatGPT, and 3 were written by medical students who previously matched into surgery residency. Blinded participants at a single institution were instructed to read all personal statements and identify which were generated by artificial intelligence; they then completed a survey exploring their opinions regarding artificial intelligence use.
Results
Of the 30 participants, 50% were faculty (n = 15) and 50% were residents (n = 15). Overall, experience ranged from 0 to 20 years (median, 2 years; interquartile range, 1–6.25 years). Artificial intelligence–derived personal statements were identified correctly only 59% of the time, with 3 (10%) participants identifying all the artificial intelligence–derived personal statements correctly. Artificial intelligence–generated personal statements were labeled as the best 60% of the time and the worst 43.3% of the time. When asked whether artificial intelligence use should be allowed in personal statements writing, 66.7% (n = 20) said no and 30% (n = 9) said yes. When asked if the use of artificial intelligence would impact their opinion of an applicant, 80% (n = 24) said yes, and 20% (n = 6) said no. When survey questions and ability to identify artificial intelligence–generated personal statements were evaluated by faculty/resident status and experience, no differences were noted (P > .05).
Conclusion
This study shows that surgical faculty and residents cannot reliably identify artificial intelligence–generated personal statements and that concerns exist regarding the impact of artificial intelligence on the application process.}

The data silos between the parties are serious, resulting in poor information flow, which affects the accuracy and practicality of the optimization model. To this end, this paper studies the application strategies and practices of artificial intelligence technology and genetic algorithms in business management supply chain optimization. First, the advantages of artificial intelligence-driven solutions in supply chain management are explored, especially in demand forecasting, inventory management, and warehouse process automation. These technologies provide real-time decision support by processing massive data, reducing inventory waste and improving logistics efficiency. Secondly, a supply chain optimization model based on genetic algorithm is constructed, and the objective function and constraints are clarified, covering key optimization goals such as cost minimization, profit maximization and service level improvement. The model continuously iterates and optimizes the supply chain configuration through the core operation steps of genetic algorithm, including population initialization, fitness evaluation, selection, crossover and mutation. The experimental results show that artificial intelligence technology and genetic algorithm can significantly reduce supply chain costs, improve logistics efficiency and enhance service levels, verifying the effectiveness of the model in practical applications.}

This paper aims to explore how artificial intelligence (AI) and Energy Storage Technology (EST) interact and co-evolve. Utilizing a full-sample Granger causality test, we identified significant interactions between AI and EST. Afterwards, we further revealed their dynamic influence relationship using advanced sub-sampling techniques. Quantitative analysis indicates that AI positively influences EST by optimizing energy management systems, with an improvement of 15 % in efficiency, and by enhancing the intelligence level of energy storage. However, there are also negative effects, such as a 10 % increase in operational risks due to over-reliance on AI. Similarly, EST facilitates the development of AI by providing a stable energy supply. AI and EST, like the intelligent brain and the energy heart, require mutual dependence for stable development. In context of the industrial revolution and technical advancement, this study provides meaningful recommendations. Strengthening technological research and innovation support, optimizing energy policies, and enhancing standardization will promote the deep integration and synergistic development of AI and EST.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming speech-language pathology (SLP) and dysphagia management, offering innovative solutions for assessment, diagnosis, and rehabilitation. This narrative review examines AI applications in these fields from 2014 to 2024, with particular focus on implementation challenges in Latin America. We analyze key AI technologies—including deep learning, machine learning algorithms, and natural language processing—that have demonstrated high accuracy in detecting voice disorders, analyzing swallowing function, and supporting personalized rehabilitation. The review identifies three primary domains of AI application: diagnostic tools with improved sensitivity for speech-language disorders, rehabilitation technologies that enable customized therapy, and telehealth platforms that expand access to specialized care in underserved regions. However, significant barriers persist, particularly in Latin America, where limited infrastructure, insufficient linguistic adaptation, and scarce regional datasets hamper widespread implementation. Our pilot study evaluating commercially available large language models for rehabilitation planning demonstrates their potential utility in generating structured therapy activities, especially in resource-constrained settings. While AI shows promise in enhancing clinical workflows and expanding service delivery, the evidence suggests that current applications remain predominantly focused on diagnosis rather than integrated rehabilitation. This review highlights the need for culturally and linguistically adapted AI models, expanded regional research collaborations, and regulatory frameworks that ensure ethical AI integration into SLP and dysphagia care, positioning these technologies as complementary tools that enhance rather than replace clinical expertise.}

This study examines how AI adoption influences marketing performance through dynamic capabilities and organizational flexibility in the context of student entrepreneurship education. Drawing on a longitudinal survey of 434 student entrepreneurs across universities in Eastern China, we employ a dual-stage analytical framework combining PLS-SEM and fsQCA to investigate the multifaceted relationships between AI drivers, dynamic capabilities, and marketing outcomes. Our findings reveal that technology-driven, organization-driven, environment-driven, and human-driven factors of AI positively influence students' dynamic capabilities—sensing, seizing, and reconfiguring—which subsequently enhance their AI-enabled marketing performance. Organizational flexibility emerges as a significant positive moderator in this relationship. The fsQCA analysis identifies six configurations leading to optimal marketing performance, providing nuanced insights for curriculum design. These findings contribute to management education literature by demonstrating how AI integration can enhance entrepreneurial learning outcomes and inform pedagogical approaches. The study offers practical implications for educators seeking to prepare students for AI-driven business environments while advancing responsible management education aligned with sustainable development goals.}

abstract = {Purpose
Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) enables banks to enhance customer service experiences. However, limited research has been conducted on factors influencing customers’ intention to switch from traditional to artificial intelligence (AI) based banking services. Therefore, the present study explored the key antecedents of the aforementioned intention.
Methods
This two-stage study was based on the push–pull–mooring model. In Stage 1, in-depth semistructured interviews were conducted with stakeholders related to AI-based banking services to identify critical factors influencing customers’ intention to switch from traditional to AI-based customer services. In Stage 2, the results obtained in Stage 1 were combined with results from the literature to create a second-order model and direct-effect model (Models 1 and 2, respectively). Quantitative survey data were then collected to validate these models.
Results
Model 1 indicated that among pull, push, and mooring factors, pull factors had the strongest effect on the aforementioned intention, followed by mooring factors and then push factors. The explanatory power (R2) of this model was 70 %. Furthermore, Model 2 indicated that the attractiveness of the alternative (a pull factor) and the need for interpersonal interaction and inertia (mooring factors) were the key factors influencing switching intention. The explanatory power (R2) of this model was 76 %.
Conclusion
In summary, this study identified and validated critical factors affecting customers’ intention to switch to AI-based banking services. The findings enrich the understanding the social interaction and user behavior of AI, offering valuable insights for promoting AI-driven services and applications.}
