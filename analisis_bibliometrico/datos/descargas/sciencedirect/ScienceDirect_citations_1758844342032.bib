abstract = {The implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) has been instrumental in the optimization of friction stir welding (FSW) parameters. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, including artificial neural networks (ANN) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS), were utilized to predict mechanical properties such as ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and optimize pivotal welding parameters, such as rotational speed, feed rate, axial force, and tilt angle. These methodologies enabled precise real-time control, thus improving the quality and consistency of the resulting welded joints. The objective of this study was to conduct a comprehensive review of the application of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques in friction stir welding (FSW). The objective of the study was to synthesize existing research using AI to predict mechanical properties and optimize welding parameters. Furthermore, the study aimed to illustrate how artificial intelligence has improved the caliber and dependability of FSW joints through real-time observation and defect identification. A systematic literature review was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines to identify relevant studies on the utilization of AI in FSW. A search algorithm was applied to databases such as ScienceDirect and Web of Science, resulting in the identification of 27 relevant scientific papers. The selection criteria were designed to identify studies that employed AI techniques for the prediction and optimization of FSW parameters. The principal findings indicated the pervasive deployment of 34 distinct AI techniques, with ANN being the most prevalent. Hybrid models combining AI with optimization algorithms, such as particle swarm optimization (PSO) and genetic algorithms, were particularly effective. These models demonstrated high precision in predicting tensile strength and detecting internal defects, significantly improving joint quality. In conclusion, AI applications in FSW have proven essential for optimizing welding processes, with hybrid AI models showing superior performance. The continued integration of AI in FSW is expected to enhance the efficiency and reliability of welding operations, offering significant industrial advantages.}

abstract = {Pharmacogenomics is entering a transformative phase as high-throughput “omics” techniques become increasingly integrated with state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) methods. Although early successes in single-gene pharmacogenetics reported clear clinical benefits, many drug response phenotypes are governed by intricate networks of genomic variants, epigenetic modifications, and metabolic pathways. Multi-omics approaches address this complexity by capturing genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic data layers, offering a comprehensive view of patient-specific biology. Advanced AI models, including deep neural networks, graph neural networks, and representation learning techniques, further enhance this landscape by detecting hidden patterns, filling gaps in incomplete data sets, and enabling in silico simulations of treatment responses. Such capabilities not only improve predictive accuracy but also deepen mechanistic insights, revealing how gene–gene and gene–environment interactions shape therapeutic outcomes. At the same time, real-world data from diverse patient populations is broadening the evidence base, underscoring the importance of inclusive datasets and population-specific algorithms to reduce health disparities. Despite challenges related to data harmonization, interpretability, and regulatory oversight, the synergy between multi-omics integration and AI-driven analytics holds relevant promise for revolutionizing clinical decision-making. In this review, we highlighted key technological advances, discussed current limitations, and outlined future directions for translating multi-omics plus AI innovations into routine personalized medicine.}

We examine several specific issues, beginning with GAI’s heavy consumption of natural resources and electricity. We then move to assessing how the rich and the Global North gain via GAI, while the poor and the Global South must deal with its adverse effects. We then move to assessing GAI’s impact on underrepresented communities and countries in the Global South; while GAI contributes to global warming, this affects people unevenly, because it is mostly rich people and the Global North that make intensive use of these technologies. After suggesting that more local and global laws are needed to regulate the sustainable use of AI, we report on how organizations can perform AI strategizing, for instance to control emissions in smart cities and improve weather forecasting. We conclude with a research agenda that aims to encourage IS scholars to focus on the environmental impact of AI, its ethical implications for organizations, and how GAI can be used strategically to benefit all.}

They mainly focus on the operational or functional levels, however, this study considers digital transformation at the strategic level. Previous studies confirmed that using new emerging AI-based technologies will enable organisations to use digital transformation to achieve higher efficiency. A novel methodological AI-based approach for policymaking was constructed into three phases through the lens of organisational learning theory. The proposed framework was validated using a case study in the transportation industry of a small municipality. In the selected case study, a confirmatory model was developed and tested utilising the Structural Equation Modelling with data collected from a survey of 494 local stakeholders. Artificial Neural Network was utilised to predict and then to identify the most appropriate policy according to cost, feasibility, and impact criteria amongst six policies extracted from the literature. The results from this research confirm that utilisation of the AI-based strategic decision-making through the proposed generative AI platform at strategic level outperforms human decision-making in terms of applicability, efficiency, and accuracy.}

abstract = {Objectives
To train and test a Random Forest machine learning model with the ability to distinguish AI-generated from human-generated textual content in the domain of public health, and public health policy.
Study design
Supervised machine learning study.
Methods
A dataset comprising 1000 human-generated and 1000 AI-generated paragraphs was created. Textual features were extracted using TF-IDF vectorization which calculates term frequency (TF) and Inverse document frequency (IDF), and combines the two measures to produce a score for individual terms. The Random Forest model was trained and tested using the Scikit-Learn library and Jupyter Notebook service in the Google Colab cloud-based environment, with Google CPU hardware acceleration.
Results
The model achieved a classification accuracy of 81.8 % and an area under the ROC curve of 0.9. For human-generated content, precision, recall, and F1-score were 0.85, 0.78, and 0.81, respectively. For AI-generated content, these metrics were 0.79, 0.86, and 0.82. The MCC value of 0.64 indicated moderate to strong predictive power. The model demonstrated robust sensitivity (recall for AI-generated class) of 0.86 and specificity (recall for human-generated class) of 0.78.
Conclusions
The model exhibited acceptable performance, as measured by classification accuracy, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, and other metrics. This approach can be further improved by incorporating additional supervised machine learning techniques and serves as a foundation for the future development of a sophisticated and innovative AI system. Such a system could play a crucial role in combating misinformation and enhancing public trust across various government platforms, media outlets, and social networks.}

abstract = {Background
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 85 % of all lung cancer cases and remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI), artificial neural networks (ANNs), and machine learning (ML) into NSCLC management has shown potential in improving diagnostic accuracy, treatment personalization, and patient outcomes. However, the impact of these technologies on patient-reported outcome measures (PROM), overall survival (OS), and cost-effectiveness remains underexplored. This systematic review aims to evaluate the impact of AI, ANNs, and ML models on PROM, OS, and cost-effectiveness in adult patients with histologically confirmed NSCLC compared to conventional research methodologies and standard-of-care approaches.
Methods
A systematic review was conducted following the PRISMA guidelines, with data synthesized using the Synthesis Without Meta-analysis (SWiM) approach. Data extraction focused on study design, patient characteristics, AI methodology, and outcomes of interest. Given the heterogeneity in study designs and statistical methods, a meta-analysis was deemed inappropriate.
Results
Ten studies were included after screening 509 articles. AI-based models demonstrated improvements in diagnostic precision, treatment optimization, and predictive accuracy for survival outcomes. AI-enhanced approaches outperformed conventional statistical models in prognosis prediction and resource allocation. However, data heterogeneity, model generalizability, and algorithmic transparency remain significant challenges.
Conclusion
Current evidence supports exploratory associations between AI models and prognostic stratification for OS; there is no evaluable evidence on PROM or cost‑effectiveness in NSCLC. Future prospective studies should incorporate validated PROM and formal economic evaluation alongside clinical endpoints. AI, ANNs, and ML have the potential to revolutionize NSCLC care by improving diagnostic accuracy and treatment outcomes. However, further research is needed to validate their real-world clinical applicability and address potential biases, ethical implications, and concerns regarding healthcare disparities.}

This added complexity to the workflow but allowed for more precise and reproducible treatment. As a result, these advances required the accurate delineation of many more volumes, raising questions about how to delineate them, in a uniform manner across centers. Then, as computing power improved, reverse planning became possible and three-dimensional dose distributions could be generated. Artificial intelligence offers the opportunity to make such workflow more efficient while increasing practice homogeneity. Many artificial intelligence-based tools are being implemented in routine practice to increase efficiency, reduce workload and improve homogeneity of treatments. Data retrieved from this workflow could be combined with clinical data and omic data to develop predictive tools to support clinical decision-making process. Such predictive tools are at the stage of proof-of-concept and need to be explainatory, prospectively validated, and based on large and multicenter cohorts. Nevertheless, they could bridge the gap to personalized radiation oncology, by personalizing oncologic strategies, dose prescriptions to tumor volumes and dose constraints to organs at risk.}

All interstellar missions are characterised by 50-100-year transits to extrasolar systems. High system availability demands that interstellar spacecraft are self-repairable imposing significant demands on onboard intelligence. We review the current status of artificial intelligence to assess its capabilities in providing such autonomy. In particular, we focus on hybrid AI methods as these appear to offer the richest capabilities in offsetting weaknesses inherent in paradigmic approaches. Symbolic manipulation systems offer logical and comprehensible rationality with predictable behaviours but are brittle beyond their specific applications (a charge that may be levelled at neural networks unless the transfer learning problem can be resolved). More modern approaches to expert systems include Bayesian networks that incorporate probabilistic treatment to accommodate uncertainty. Artificial neural networks are fundamentally different. They are opaque to analysis but potentially offer greater adaptability in application by virtue of their ability to learn. Indeed, deep machine learning is a variation on neural networks with unsupervised neural front ends and supervised neural back ends. Reinforcement learning offers a promising approach for learning directly from the environment. There are inherent weaknesses in neural approaches regarding their hidden mechanisms rendering their distributed representations opaque to analysis. Hybridising symbolic processing techniques with artificial neural networks appears to offer the advantages of both. Human cognition appears to implement both neural learning and symbolic processing. There are several approaches to such hybridisation that we explore including knowledge-based artificial neural networks, fuzzy neural networks, Bayesian methods such as Markov logic networks and genetic methods such as learning classifier systems. Markov logic networks propose a natural correlation between Bayesian probability and neural weights but mapping representation of symbols into switching neurons is less clear (though vector symbolic architectures present an approach) while learning classifier systems are reinforcement learning methods that are promising for interacting with the physical world. We conclude that current AI may not yet be up to the task of interstellar transits and flybys let alone for physical interaction with unknown planetary environments. Certainly, AI is incapable of interactive encounters with extraterrestrial intelligence.}

The survey included responses from a total of 1107 postgraduate education students, 72.4% of whom were females enrolled in various education courses. With 394 (35.4%) respondents previously enrolled in Bachelor of Secondary Education (BSED), 295 (26.6%) in Bachelor of Elementary Education (BEED), 61 (5.5%) in Bachelor of Early Childhood Education (BECED), 186 (16.8%) in Bachelor of Culture and Arts Education (BCAED), and a total of 120 (10.85%) of participants enrolled in Bachelor of Special Needs Education (BSNED). The Kolmogorov-Smirvov test was used to ensure the normal distribution of the data. Furthermore, the findings indicate that 49.6% of the respondents utilized AI for general learning and that 64.6% of postgraduates strongly agreed that AI provides support for learning. Moreover, the study revealed a significant correlation between the use and benefits of artificial intelligence in developing the skills of postgraduate students, which generally equate to improved employability skills.}

abstract = {Most applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) are designed for a confined and specific task. However, there are many scenarios that call for a more general AI, capable of solving a wide array of tasks without being specifically designed for them. The term General Purpose Artificial Intelligence Systems (GPAIS) has been defined to refer to these AI systems. To date, the possibility of an Artificial General Intelligence, powerful enough to perform any intellectual task as if it were human, or even improve it, has remained an aspiration, fiction, and considered a risk for our society. Whilst we might still be far from achieving that, GPAIS is a reality and sitting at the forefront of AI research. This work discusses existing definitions for GPAIS and proposes a new definition that allows for a gradual differentiation among types of GPAIS according to their properties and limitations. We distinguish between closed-world and open-world GPAIS, characterising their degree of autonomy and ability based on several factors such as adaptation to new tasks, competence in domains not intentionally trained for, ability to learn from few data, or proactive acknowledgement of their own limitations. We then propose a taxonomy of approaches to realise GPAIS, describing research trends such as the use of AI techniques to improve another AI (commonly referred to as AI-powered AI) or (single) foundation models. As a prime example, we delve into generative AI (GenAI), aligning them with the terms and concepts presented in the taxonomy. Similarly, we explore the challenges and prospects of multi-modality, which involves fusing various types of data sources to expand the capabilities of GPAIS. Through the proposed definition and taxonomy, our aim is to facilitate research collaboration across different areas that are tackling general purpose tasks, as they share many common aspects. Finally, with the goal of providing a holistic view of GPAIS, we discuss the current state of GPAIS, its prospects, implications for our society, and the need for regulation and governance of GPAIS to ensure their responsible and trustworthy development.}

abstract = {Background
Depression is a widespread mental health disorder that affects quality of life, with traditional treatments often resource-intensive. Studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of CBT-based AI in alleviating depressive symptoms through autonomous mental health management.
Purpose
To evaluate the effect and the integration level of Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy-based artificial intelligence (AI) on autonomous health management in depressive symptoms care.
Methods
This systematic review used the PRISMA methodology and a mixed-methods appraisal tool. Studies included randomized controlled trials using artificial intelligence interventions for depression, analysing theoretical frameworks, intervention designs, and outcomes. Reviews and protocols were excluded. Data sources were searched in the Cochrane Library, CINAHL Plus with Full Text, and PubMed for articles published between October 2019 and October 2024.
Results
Five studies demonstrated that artificial intelligence designs incorporating the Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy guidance framework specifically indicated short-term intervention effectiveness. Of these AI interventions, only partial integration of 54 % implemented a theoretical framework in AI design. Nevertheless, findings revealed a significant 60 % decrease in depressive symptoms among participants who engaged with the AI-based autonomous mental health management, particularly those with moderate-to-severe depression, when grounded in a strong theoretical foundation.
Conclusion
Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy-based artificial intelligence interventions have demonstrated effectiveness in decrease depressive symptoms through patient self-management platforms. The theory-driven approach not only guides the development of AI applications but also facilitates the implementation of automated mental health interventions, thereby reducing the workload of nursing staff. This integration of CBT-guided AI technology empowers patients with self-management tools while optimizing nursing resources in mental health settings.}

This integration raises critical questions about the capabilities employees need to maintain a positive outlook on the rise of AI and the future of their career. We explore how goal reengagement capacities shape the impact of human-AI interaction. In two experimental studies, we develop a moderated mediation model in which goal reengagement capacities moderate the path from AI interaction (vs. a control group) through perceived threat of AI to career-related optimism. Using two experimental studies with students (N = 355) and full-time employees (N = 186), we show that individuals' goal reengagement capacities moderate the indirect relationship between AI interaction and career-related optimism via perceived threat of AI, such that this indirect effect is negative for those with low goal reengagement capacities and positive for those with high goal reengagement capacities. Our findings underscore the value of letting go of previously held goals and embracing new ones as AI reshapes the world of work, and highlight goal reengagement capacities as critical for maintaining career optimism in an AI-transformed workplace.}

First, through human coding, we determine whether student essays submitted as homework were created by humans or software, and second, we examine these essays' sentiment and authorship, as well as factors determining the use of artificial intelligence in learning. Data collection was conducted in April and May 2024 across thirty classes from twenty Hungarian high schools. Our results show that 16 % of high school students (N = 548) wrote their text-based homework assignments using artificial intelligence, though neither age nor parents' average educational level determined the use of AI in learning. Although women have more positive attitudes toward using AI for learning purposes, they are less likely to use it to complete their homework assignments. Finally, we found that fears related to artificial intelligence are general and lack specificity. Our findings have three practical implications: 1) they highlight the need for targeted educational programs to develop ethical AI use, 2) they assist teachers in identifying AI-generated texts, and 3) they draw attention to gender differences in AI usage.}

The investigation yields effective artificial intelligence algorithms that capture the essential and non-essential components of numerous parameters to be monitored in nuclear reactor control. The investigation further examines the interdependencies between various parameters and validates the statistical outputs of the model through attribution analysis. Furthermore, a Multivariant ANOVA analysis is conducted to identify the interactive plots and mean plots of crucial parameters interactions. The artificial intelligence algorithms demonstrate the correlation between the number of vacant staff jobs and both the frequency of license event reports each year and the ratio of contract employees to regular employees in the administrative domain. An AI method uncovers the relationships between the operator failing rate (OFR), operator processed errors (OEE), and operations at limited time frames (OLC). The AI algorithm reveals the interdependence between equipment in the out of service (EOS), progressive maintenance schedule (PRMR), and preventive maintenance schedules (PMRC). Effective machine learning neural network models are derived from generative adversarial network (GAN) algorithms and proposed for administrative, operational and maintenance loops of nuclear reactor control unit.}

The firm promotes a romantic-managerial conception of AI that suggests business specialists can help organizations reap the benefits of the miraculous promises of a human-centered AI, without incurring any of the drawbacks, based on the assumption that it is possible to control AI. Three complementary discursive archetypes are mobilized by the firm to spur organizations into action: the prophet, arousing enthusiasm by spreading the “Good News” about AI; the demystifier, numbing concerns about the potential drifts of the technical society; and the bird of ill omen, stoking a fear of inertia. This study highlights the relevance of Jacques Ellul’s work to stimulate the ongoing debate within the critical accounting community about the perils of AI’s proliferation in organizations and society. Beyond its traditional function of legitimizing expertise, content marketing is mobilized as a propaganda vehicle for a conception of AI seemingly shaped in the mold of the firm’s own professional services offering.

A systematic review methodology, following PRISMA-ScR guidelines, was employed to analyse studies from 2017 to 2025, identifying the AI algorithms most frequently used to personalise gaming experiences, improve patient engagement, and increase treatment efficacy. Our proposal categorises the algorithms based on their role in the game environment, which can either be game control or user assessment. Game control algorithms adapt the game environment and difficulty, while user assessment algorithms gather information about the player's state, such as performance, mood, or physiological data, to evaluate the treatment progress. The review also examines the growing trend of using multimodal data as input for machine learning models. Results show that a few well-known algorithms, such as Decision Trees (DT), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Fuzzy Logic (FL), Naïve Bayes (NB), and Support Vector Machines (SVM), are frequently used. However, there is a clear distinction in their purposes: while FL is typically applied to game control tasks, SVMs are mainly used for user assessment. This review offers valuable insights for researchers in the field, providing a comprehensive overview of the suitability of different AI algorithms for various tasks in SGs, with a particular focus on personalisation and motivation.}

abstract = {Identifying embryos with the highest likelihood of successful implantation is a critical component of the in vitro fertilization (IVF) process. Visual assessments are limited by the subjectivity of embryologists, making consistent evaluation of embryo health challenging with traditional methods. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI)—particularly in computer vision and deep learning—have enabled the automated analysis of embryo morphology images, reducing subjectivity and improving evaluation efficiency. Through an extensive literature search using keywords such as “embryo health assessment” and “artificial intelligence,” the present review focuses on AI-driven approaches for automated embryo evaluation. It examines AI techniques applied to embryo assessment across the early development, blastocyst, and full developmental stages. This review indicated the promising potential of AI technologies in enhancing the precision, consistency, and speed of embryo selection. AI models have been reported to outperform manual evaluations across several parameters, offering promising opportunities to improve success rates and operational efficiency in reproductive medicine. Additionally, this review discusses the current limitations of AI implementation in clinical settings and explores future research directions. Overall, the review provides insight into AI’s growing role in advancing embryo selection and highlights the path toward fully automated evaluation systems in assisted reproductive technology.}

abstract = {Rationale and Objectives
Hyperpolarized 129Xenon magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures the extent of lung ventilation by ventilation defect percent (VDP), but VDP alone cannot distinguish between diseases. Prior studies have reported anecdotal evidence of disease-specific defect patterns such as wedge-shaped defects in asthma and polka-dot defects in lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM). Neural network artificial intelligence can evaluate image shapes and textures to classify images, but this has not been attempted in xenon MRI. We hypothesized that an artificial intelligence network trained on ventilation MRI could classify diseases based on spatial patterns in lung MR images alone.
Materials and Methods
Xenon MRI data in six pulmonary conditions (control, asthma, bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, cystic fibrosis, LAM) were used to train convolutional neural networks. Network performance was assessed with top-1 and top-2 accuracy, recall, precision, and one-versus-all area under the curve (AUC). Gradient class-activation-mapping (Grad-CAM) was used to visualize what parts of the images were important for classification.
Results
Training/testing data were collected from 262 participants. The top performing network (VGG-16) had top-1 accuracy=56%, top-2 accuracy=78%, recall=.30, precision=.70, and AUC=.85. The network performed better on larger classes (top-1 accuracy: control=62% [n=57], CF=67% [n=85], LAM=69% [n=61]) and outperformed human observers (human top-1 accuracy=40%, network top-1 accuracy=61% on a single training fold).
Conclusion
We developed an artificial intelligence tool that could classify disease from xenon ventilation images alone that outperformed human observers. This suggests that xenon images have additional, disease-specific information that could be useful for cases that are clinically challenging or for disease phenotyping.}

We obtained participants’ responses through a research company using an online survey. The sample was stratified by quotas following the distribution of the Spanish population. All participants received an economic compensation for their participation. The dataset featured in this article contains data of 1,541 participants on support for technocracy of artificial intelligence (AI), subjective socioeconomic status, political orientation, and other related variables such as financial threat, financial scarcity, perceived socioeconomic decline, perceived economic inequality, and relative deprivation. The survey also collected sociodemographic data. Importantly, these data were collected during a period of political elections in some regions of Spain. This is the first dataset on support for technocracy of AI and social and political attitudes that may shape it in current societies. It is proposed to consider this dataset as a help to clarify and examine the relationship between the perception of economic situation and support for an AI technocracy. This data publication could offer new perspectives for addressing current political and economic challenges, proposing solutions based on data and the potential factors that foster trust in AI as a part of government.}

This study employs the Critical Interpretive Synthesis (CIS) approach to explore the impacts and challenges of AI on graphic design. Through a comprehensive review of 33 papers, this research reveals four research paradigms of AI in graphic design: Artificial Intelligence Driven Design Automation and Generation (AIDAG), Artificial Intelligence Assisted Graphic Design and Image Processing (AGDIP), Artificial Intelligence in Art and Creative Design Processes (AACDP), and Artificial Intelligence Enhanced Visual Attention and Emotional Response Modeling (AVERM). These paradigms demonstrate the multidimensional role of AI in design, ranging from automation to emotional interaction. The findings suggest that AI serves a dual role as both a design tool and a medium for innovation. AI not only enhances the automation and efficiency of the design process but also fosters designers' creative thinking and understanding of users' emotional needs.

The primary research question focuses on the feasibility of learning advantageous microstructural features from stochastic microstructure samples to facilitate the generative design of periodic microstructures, resulting in unprecedented properties. Instead of relying on brainstorming-based, ad hoc design inspiration approaches, we propose an eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)-based framework to automatically learn critical features from the exceptional outliers (with respect to properties) in stochastic microstructure samples, enabling the generation of novel periodic microstructure patterns with superior properties. This framework is demonstrated on three benchmark cases: designing 2D cellular metamaterials to maximize stiffness in all directions, to maximize the Poisson’s ratio in all directions, and to minimize the thermal expansion ratio. The effectiveness of the design framework is validated by comparing its novel microstructure designs with known stochastic and periodic microstructure designs in terms of the properties of interest.}

Nonetheless, the potential role of artificial intelligence (AI) and institutional quality in the energy transition-carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions relationship is rare and complex in the literature. To fill this critical research gap, this study performs empirical analyses of the relationship between AI and CO2 emissions in 35 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries between 1990 and 2020, considering the critical role of institutions and energy transition in enhancing the environmental advantages of energy transition and promoting Sustainable Development Goal 13 (SDG-13). To pursue the study's objective, the newly introduced Augmented Anderson-Hsiao (AAH) estimator, an efficient technique for panel data analysis, was employed. The AHH estimator's results indicate that a 1% increase in the green quality index significantly reduces CO2 emissions by approximately 66.7%. Additionally, AI has a negative impact on the environment through its detrimental effects on carbon emissions. Finally, institutional quality has a positive and significant impact on reducing CO2 emissions, indicating a beneficial effect on improving environmental performance. These findings highlight the importance of investments in AI-enabled sustainable technologies, robust institutional frameworks, and strategic regulatory measures to expedite global decarbonization.}

However, regulatory, ethical, and technical challenges must be addressed to ensure its safe and effective implementation. Bias in AI can lead to disparities in healthcare delivery, while the “black-box problem” raises concerns about transparency and trust. Ethical principles must guide AI integration, particularly regarding patient safety, accountability, and liability. Privacy risks related to data collection and security are especially critical in ophthalmology, where large imaging datasets are essential. Additionally, AI-generated inaccuracies, or “hallucinations,” pose potential risks to clinical decision-making. Cybersecurity threats targeting AI-powered healthcare systems further emphasize the need for robust protections. Despite these challenges, AI has the potential to improve access to ophthalmic care, particularly in underserved regions, as seen in AI-assisted diabetic retinopathy screening. However, financial and infrastructural barriers remain significant obstacles to widespread adoption. Addressing these issues requires collaboration among stakeholders, including regulators, healthcare providers, AI developers, and policymakers, to establish clear guidelines and promote trustworthy AI systems. This review explores key regulatory and ethical concerns and highlights strategies to ensure the responsible integration of AI into ophthalmology.}

abstract = {Summary
In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a powerful tool in healthcare and is becoming increasingly prevalent across all medical and paramedical disciplines. AI has numerous applications in pharmacology. This narrative review explores the increasing importance of AI in three key areas of pharmacology: pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and pharmacovigilance (PV), as well as pharmacology education. We conducted a literature review enhanced by the ARTIREV hybrid bibliometric tool to identify and analyze key advances, applications, and challenges with AI integration in this field. In PK, machine learning and hybrid approaches improve the prediction of individualized drug exposure, support model-informed precision dosing and handle irregular and sparse data through architectures such as recurrent neural networks and NeuralODEs. In PD, AI facilitates a shift towards an era of precision and personalized medicine by enabling the development of drug effect models and considering inter-individual variability. It also makes it easier to implement adaptive dosing regimens that are tailored to various constraints. Regarding PV, AI enhances the detection of adverse drug reactions, the identification of safety signals at the population level and the assessment of preclinical toxicities through the analysis of unstructured data, particularly from electronic health records. Despite their potential, AI models face several significant limitations. These include the quality of training data, limited explainability due to the “black box” effect and a lack of external validation of the models developed. Altogether, this review emphasizes the role of AI in pharmacology and the necessity of training future professionals to ensure the safe and validated use of AI in personalized medical applications.}

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is a multidisciplinary scientific field that uses machines to solve real-world problems and predict outcomes. Despite the current enthusiasm about AI's potential as a clinical support tool, there is also a growing awareness and concern about the potentially harmful effects of AI. Because AI will likely impact expert-based decision-making in medicine, it is critical to consider the issues that AI raises in medical research. This paper outlines the AI guidelines of the Australian Epilepsy Project. This large-scale platform aims to democratise specialist care in epilepsy and use AI for clinical decision support based on prospective multimodal datasets (MRI, genetic, clinical, and cognitive data) from thousands of people with epilepsy. As AI develops rapidly, we focus on key areas of medical AI identified in the literature, including Trust, Responsibility and Safety. We believe AI is changing medicine, and we believe it is imperative to advance and update our AI guidelines adaptably while preparing for an era of augmented-intelligence-based medicine.}

However, extensive research has revealed limitations in using AGIM in education, particularly in terms of controllability, trustworthiness, explainability, evaluation and feedback, security, and privacy. Therefore, standardization in AGIMs for Education (AGIME) is urgently required to provide normative guidance for developing artificial intelligence systems in education. This study first explores an AGIME standardization process with the methodology of use case collection and iterative research. We then propose the definition and attributes of AGIME and establish a standard system framework for the AGIME life cycle. This framework includes published specifications such as information model, data specification, evaluation specification, and application requirements on teaching and learning. We introduce standard application cases to validate the effectiveness of AGIME standard system framework. Finally, we present several specifications currently under development within this standard system, including interface, regulatory, operation and maintenance, and security, ethics, and privacy specifications. This study provides references for AGIME development and deployment, ensuring the technical stability, data credibility, evaluation accuracy, and pedagogical applicability of AGIME.}

abstract = {Objective
To systematically review the utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) in health literacy, highlighting limitations and future developments.
Methods
A systematic review, following PRISMA guidelines, was conducted searching six databases for studies published from January 1, 2014, through April 10, 2024. Data extracted included: population characteristics, health literacy definitions and measurement, study objectives, AI techniques, metrics. Risk of bias was assessed using an adapted checklist.
Results
From 1296 studies, 18 met inclusion criteria. These studies primarily evaluated text-based materials, including online articles, and electronic health records, with most materials in English, but also incorporated other languages. AI played various roles, including evaluating complexity, text simplification/readability enhancement, translation, and question-answering. Only five studies involved participant engagement. Seven studies provided a health literacy definition, consistently describing it as an individual's ability to obtain, understand, and use health information for informed decisions, often linking it to external factors. However, only one study incorporated an individual-level health literacy measurement tool, while organizational-level health literacy measurement remained largely overlooked. The AI techniques used included traditional machine learning, deep learning, and transformer-based models. Evaluation metrics were categorized into human evaluation, readability and machine learning metrics.
Conclusion
The review highlights AI's dynamic application in relation to health literacy, however, measurement of health literacy, at both an individual and organizational level, to evidence AI's effectiveness remains limited. In addition, future work should not only measure health literacy outcomes more rigorously but also pursue research on enhancing AI model performance, robust evaluation and their practical implementation in real-world settings.}

WHO defines SCD as sudden unexpected death either within 1 h of symptom onset (witnessed) or within 24 h of having been observed alive and symptom-free (unwitnessed). Sudden cardiac arrest is a major cause of mortality worldwide, with survival to hospital discharge for hospital cardiac arrest and in-hospital cardiac arrest being only 9.3 % and 21.2 %, respectively, despite treatment highlighting the importance of effectively predicting and preventing cardiac arrest. This literature review aims to explore the role and application of AI (Artificial Intelligence) in predicting and preventing sudden cardiac arrest.
Material and methods
Eligible studies were searched from PubMed and Web of Science. The inclusion criteria were fulfilled if sudden cardiac death prediction and prevention, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning were included.
Conclusions
Artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning have shown remarkable prospects in SCA risk stratification, which can improve the survival rate from SCA. Nonetheless, they have not been adequately trained and tested, necessitating further studies with explainable techniques, larger sample sizes, external validation, more diverse patient samples, multimodal tools, ethics, and bias mitigation to unlock their full potential.}

In this study, we utilise the wavelet-based quantile on quantile regression (QQR) to capture the evolving impact of the Artificial Intelligence Enabler Index (AII) on the Global ESG Index (ESGI). Based on raw data, AII's impact on ESGI varies across different quantiles, indicating artificial intelligence doesn't always boost ESG performance. We use wavelet analysis to explore AII's effects on ESGI over various time horizons. AII has more negative impacts in the short term due to early technology stages, slow social adaptation, and limited ESG awareness. However, in the medium to long term, AII's positives may outweigh its negatives, fueled by technological progress, efficiency gains, wider ESG adoption, and artificial intelligence applications in ESG. Hence, our analysis reveals that artificial intelligence's inhibitory effect on ESG performance is more pronounced in the short run. Still, its enhancement effect becomes significant over the medium to long term. In the face of a new technological revolution and industrial transformation, we will offer practical advice to boost ESG progress using artificial intelligence while simultaneously fostering energy transition.}

Qualitative data analysis from a co-curricular creative writing programme, including reflections, surveys, and focus-group interviews, reveals emerging artificial intelligence literacies and students’ improvisational aptitudes for interpreting, subverting, and transforming notions of authorship. Students decentred authorial attribution through the pragmatic adoption of the technology as a creative catalyst, negotiated creative conventions by adopting non-conventional communication strategies, and reconceptualised creativity as distributed across human and non-human agents. Our approach of student-driven learning for autonomous exploration, sense-making, and criticality with GenAI indicates the potential for promoting conditions for students to exercise intellectual equality and emancipation. The findings contribute to the understanding of authorship and creativity; begin to contour emerging GenAI literacies and competencies; and suggest that creative collaborations with GenAI may be a promising way to foster emancipatory practices in the classroom, while nurturing creative and critical skills.}

abstract = {Background
Bioavailability, defined as the extent to which active components in food are absorbed and utilized by the body, is a critical factor in determining the health benefits of food. The intricate interactions of various critical aspects, particularly those concerning extensive, complicated datasets of host conditions and ingredient matrix effects, are obstacles to bioavailability research. These difficulties influence research on intestinal absorption efficiency, solubility, and chemical stability.
Scope and approach
One effective tool for overcoming these challenges is artificial intelligence (AI). AI models can be used to analyse and forecast the bioavailability of food ingredients under various processing conditions and food matrix compositions by analyzing sizable datasets, as well as reveal the effects of these parameters. The aims of this review are to provide a theoretical foundation for AI-based bioavailability research, describe applicable methods, outline prospective research directions for AI-based innovation in food science and nutrition, and address existing difficulties.
Key findings and conclusions
The use of AI in bioavailability research on proteins, peptides, carbohydrates, and micronutrients has transformative potential. AI-based models can be used to simultaneously deduce structures, optimize excipient ingredients, devise distribution systems, offer research guidance and minimize experimental trials. However, the application of these models is hampered by the following factors: (1) the absence of high-quality standardized datasets that accurately represent biological complexity, which may result in model overfitting and bias; (2) the restricted mechanistic interpretability of "black box" algorithms, which impedes regulatory approval and scientific validation; and (3) interdisciplinary validation challenges between computational predictions and in vitro and in vivo experimental outcomes.}

Justice considerations arise from potential inequities in AI development and deployment. Autonomy is challenged when clinicians cannot fully explain algorithmic decision-making, affecting shared decision-making with families. These ethical tensions are particularly acute in neonatology, where decisions impact vulnerable patients who cannot advocate for themselves.

These findings were compared with responses from a sample of Australian and Chinese trainee teachers, comprising individuals nearing qualification with varied demographic and educational backgrounds. Eight vignettes depicting students with varying abilities and efforts were evaluated by the LLMs ten times each, resulting in 320 evaluations, with trainee teachers providing comparable ratings. For LD students, the LLMs exhibited lower frustration and higher sympathy than trainee teachers, while for non-LD students, LLMs similarly showed lower frustration, with ChatGPT3.5 aligning closely with Chinese teachers and ChatGPT4 demonstrating more sympathy than both teacher groups. Notably, LLMs expressed lower expectations of future academic failure for both LD and non-LD students compared to trainee teachers. Regarding feedback, the findings reflect ratings of the qualitative nature of feedback LLMs and teachers would provide, rather than actual feedback text. The LLMs, particularly ChatGPT3.5 and Gemini, were rated as providing more negative feedback than trainee teachers, while ChatGPT4 provided more positive ratings for both LD and non-LD students, aligning with Chinese teachers in some cases. These findings suggest that LLMs may promote a positive and inclusive outlook for LD students by exhibiting lower judgmental tendencies and higher optimism. However, their tendency to rate feedback more negatively than trainee teachers highlights the need to recalibrate AI tools to better align with cultural and emotional nuances.}

Creative problem-solving methods, in particular, present an intriguing means of researching AI’s capacity to identify problems within ambiguous situations, while also generating relevant, useful solutions that respond to authentic, real-world issues in a meaningful way. This paper examined the performance of three separate AI entries generated by GPT-4o as compared with 68 human team entries from students in grades 7–9 within the competitive World Solutions Challenge offered by the Future Problem Solving Program International (FPSPI). The three entries were blind-scored by trained human evaluators for measures of effectiveness, impact, humaneness, creative strength, and development of action plan. Though all three AI entries scored in the top 15 % for all measures, including achieving the top scores for effectiveness, impact, humaneness, development of action plan, and overall performance, the AI entries were not found to be significantly different than the student control group on the measure of creative strength. The results suggest that AI models like GPT-4 may approach human-like abilities on certain aspects of creative performance during a more comprehensive creative process than divergent thinking alone, providing new insight into the current creative strengths—and limitations—of existing AI models.}

However, the growing popularity and influence of models such as ChatGPT have raised concerns in education regarding academic integrity, as AI-generated content challenges the authenticity of student work and complicates traditional assessment practices. Existing plagiarism detection tools, such as Turnitin and GPTZero, attempt to identify AI-generated content; however, their reliability remains limited, as most struggle to accurately differentiate between human and AI essays. To address existing tools limitations, we propose a novel detection model leveraging three large language models (LLMs): Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2 (GPT-2), Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach (RoBERTa), and Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers (BART). We first fine-tuned each model on two large-scale datasets to evaluate their effectiveness in distinguishing between human and AI-generated essays. To further enhance the performance, we applied both manual and automated hyperparameter optimization techniques, including Random Search, Grid Search, and Bayesian Optimization. Building on these experiments, we developed our BART-CNN model, which incorporates the best-performing BART configuration with an additional convolutional head classifier. Our BART-CNN model achieved impressive Macro F1-scores of 99.78 % and 98.10 % on the Kaggle and Hugging Face datasets, respectively, and demonstrated significant performance gains over baseline methods in cross-domain validation. Our study offers a critical advancement in AI plagiarism detection, helping to uphold academic standards and the assessment quality in an evolving AI landscape.}

With the advent of the intelligent era, how artificial intelligence affects corporate tax avoidance has become an important topic of existing researches. We take Chinese A-share enterprises from 2008 to 2023 as the research samples, and empirically test the impact and mechanisms of artificial intelligence on corporate tax avoidance. Based on the perspective of corporate governance costs, we discuss the influence and function mechanism of artificial intelligence on corporate tax avoidance. The results show that artificial intelligence can promote tax avoidance for enterprises by increasing high-skilled labor cost and intelligent input cost. Heterogeneity analysis reveals that artificial intelligence exerts a more influence on corporate tax avoidance in circumstances where tax regulatory intensity is diminished, and the tax burden is escalated. This study enriches the research on the development of enterprise intelligence in the new era, opens the "black box" between artificial intelligence and tax avoidance, and provides evidence for the logic between them.}

To assess the current state of artificial intelligence (AI) policies, educational resources, and perceptions within U.S. plastic surgery residency programs from the perspectives of program directors (PDs) and residents.
Design
Cross-sectional study using 2 anonymized surveys to evaluate AI-related policies, current use, educational tools, perceived barriers, and attitudes toward AI use in surgical education and residency applications.
Setting
Plastic surgery residency programs across the United States
Participants
Program directors (n = 77) were invited via email, with 24 (31%) responding. Residents (n = 89) were recruited via social media; 1 resident per program was randomly selected to ensure institutional diversity, with 23 (26%) completing the survey.
Results
Institutional adoption of AI was limited. Only 8% of PDs reported screening residency applications for AI-generated content, and 88% indicated their programs had no formal policies on AI use. AI-based educational tools were available in 13% of programs, 21% offered AI ethics training, and 8% reported using AI to assess surgical skill. Barriers included lack of expertise (65%), data privacy concerns (52%), cost (48%), and limited evidence of efficacy (48%). In contrast, residents reported substantial independent AI use (50%). Residents used platforms such as ChatGPT (50%), Google Gemini, Microsoft Copilot, and Claude (each 9%)—often to generate clinical explanations (43%), procedural guides (17%), and differential diagnoses (13%). One resident also reported undergoing AI-based surgical skill assessment. Despite this engagement, 74% stated their programs lacked AI-related educational resources. Residents expressed moderate trust in AI (mean 5.26/10), stating it “probably” or “definitely” has a place in their education (86%).
Conclusions
A marked discrepancy exists between institutional policies and resident usage of AI in plastic surgery education. As residents adopt these tools independently, there is an urgent need for evidence-based guidelines, validated resources, and structured implementation to ensure safe, effective integration into surgical training.}

In the luxury sector, its incorporation presents a particular complexity, as it requires a delicate balance between technological efficiency and the preservation of the symbolic, aesthetic, and emotional values that shape brand identity. This study aims to explore how professionals within the luxury sector perceive the integration of artificial intelligence and what conditions they consider necessary for the technology to be adopted without compromising exclusivity or the distinctive customer experience. The research followed a qualitative, exploratory methodology, based on semi-structured interviews with experts from various fields related to luxury management, technological innovation, and brand experience. Findings indicate that the acceptance of artificial intelligence in the luxury context depends on its ability to integrate invisibly, reinforce the narrative and emotional dimensions of the experience, and function as a relational infrastructure rather than an autonomous tool. Key strategies identified include its curatorial role in personalization processes and its cross-functional incorporation into collaborative organizational dynamics. From a practical standpoint, these results offer guidance for implementing advanced technologies in environments where cultural and symbolic sensitivity is essential to perceived value. The value of this study lies in proposing an alternative understanding of artificial intelligence as a symbolic mediator rather than a purely technical solution, thereby offering new insights for its application in identity-rich contexts.}

abstract = {Background
Recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in large language models, have shown promise in various fields, including health care. However, their performance on specialized medical board examinations, such as interventional cardiology assessments, remains relatively unexplored.
Methods
A cross-sectional study was conducted using a data set comprising 360 questions from the Cath Self Assessment Program (CathSAP) question bank. This study aimed to assess the overall performance of Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) and compare it to that of average test takers. Additionally, the study evaluated the impact of pertinent educational materials on ChatGPT’s responses, both before and after exposure. The primary outcome measures included ChatGPT’s overall percentage score on the CathSAP examination and its performance across various subsections. Statistical significance was determined using the Kruskal-Wallis equality-of-populations rank test.
Results
Initially, ChatGPT achieved an overall score of 54.44% on the CathSAP exam, which improved significantly to 79.16% after exposure to relevant textual content. The improvement was statistically significant (P = .0003). Notably, the improved score was comparable with the average score achieved by typical test takers (as reported by CathSAP). ChatGPT demonstrated proficiency in sections covering basic science, pharmacology, and miscellaneous topics, although it struggled with anatomy, anatomic variants, and anatomic pathology questions.
Conclusions
The study demonstrates ChatGPT’s potential for learning and adapting to medical examination scenarios, with a notable enhancement in performance after exposure to educational materials. However, limitations such as the model’s inability to process certain visual materials and potential biases in AI models warrant further consideration. These findings underscore the need for continued research to optimize the use of AI in medical education and assessment.}

abstract = {Purpose
Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) enables banks to enhance customer service experiences. However, limited research has been conducted on factors influencing customers’ intention to switch from traditional to artificial intelligence (AI) based banking services. Therefore, the present study explored the key antecedents of the aforementioned intention.
Methods
This two-stage study was based on the push–pull–mooring model. In Stage 1, in-depth semistructured interviews were conducted with stakeholders related to AI-based banking services to identify critical factors influencing customers’ intention to switch from traditional to AI-based customer services. In Stage 2, the results obtained in Stage 1 were combined with results from the literature to create a second-order model and direct-effect model (Models 1 and 2, respectively). Quantitative survey data were then collected to validate these models.
Results
Model 1 indicated that among pull, push, and mooring factors, pull factors had the strongest effect on the aforementioned intention, followed by mooring factors and then push factors. The explanatory power (R2) of this model was 70 %. Furthermore, Model 2 indicated that the attractiveness of the alternative (a pull factor) and the need for interpersonal interaction and inertia (mooring factors) were the key factors influencing switching intention. The explanatory power (R2) of this model was 76 %.
Conclusion
In summary, this study identified and validated critical factors affecting customers’ intention to switch to AI-based banking services. The findings enrich the understanding the social interaction and user behavior of AI, offering valuable insights for promoting AI-driven services and applications.}
