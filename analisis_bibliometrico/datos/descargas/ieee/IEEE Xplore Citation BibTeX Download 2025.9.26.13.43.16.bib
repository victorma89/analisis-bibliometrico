  pages={1-6},
  abstract={Given the high demands of bridge maintenance in the network of federal highways in Germany, in particular bridge inspections are essential for assessing their condition. These hands-on inspections are largely conducted visually and documentation is largely manual using analog documentation methods. The results are a heterogeneous data collection and subjective decisions regarding the choice of measures.Modern technologies like artificial intelligence, augmented reality and BIM promise enormous potential to modernize this process by making it more objective, reliable and economical. This paper presents digital methods for bridge inspection based on the experiences from two research projects of the Federal Highway and Transport Research Institute (BASt) with Ruhr University Bochum and Hochtief Engineering GmbH Vicon including demonstrators developed with practitioners. These investigations focused on detection and localization of visual detectable defects, but also their connection to the digital twin bridge. Furthermore, an ongoing successor study on the chronology of image data sets and their predictive potential for structural damage is presented.},

  pages={1-6},
  abstract={A table-native AI model that shortens time-to-value for predictive activities on tabular data is being built by SAP. It is called the SAP Foundation Model. The goal is to build a general-purpose prediction engine that can automatically generate predictions from tabular data with minimal or no more training data. Although LLMs excel at text generation, they struggle with business-related data that is tabular and has challenges with categorisation, regression, and prediction. In fact, the SAP Foundation Model can compete with and even surpass these conventional methods while providing the flexibility of foundation models; in contrast, state-of-the-art LLMs perform 20-50% worse than incumbent restricted AI approaches in comparable cases. SAP has a long track record of successfully meeting business needs, and the company's stated goal is to develop AI that is useful, trustworthy, and socially conscious so that it can assist clients in solving their business challenges. Another innovative strategy for AI development, federated learning is quickly becoming the standard for delivering AI apps to the periphery of industrial networks. Research into the development of ethical guidelines and frameworks for the deployment of AI in MIS should prioritize the safety and security of data. In order to reap the benefits of AI integration for businesses, one must first establish a cohesive digital business plan. Another is getting people to interact with AI despite obstacles.},

Also in length and angle metrology, opportunities are opening up to use artificial intelligence to solve technical issues. This is not only related to technology, but also to the social factor. With increasing problems related to the availability of highly qualified staff, the use of artificial intelligence methods in the selection of measurement strategy, measurement conditions, filtration techniques and other elements affecting the implementation of the measurement process and obtaining a correct measurement result, becomes a necessity. This paper discusses the possibilities of using artificial intelligence in length metrology. In the macro scale the selection of the measurement strategy and measurement conditions for contact and non-contact technology devices is presented. On a micro scale, the possibility of selecting filtration techniques and unevenness parameters for functional applications is shown.},

  abstract={As a crucial strategic support for advancing national education, artificial intelligence possesses immense application potential. Developed by OpenAI, the generative artificial intelligence model, ChatGPT, has attracted considerable attention and sparked extensive debate since its launch. This study, taking ChatGPT as an exemplar, explores the prospective applications of generative artificial intelligence in English education based on its four core competences: text generation, contextual dialogue understanding, sequential task accomplishment, and programming language interpretation capabilities. The inquiry probes into ChatGPT’s potential to augment students’ English proficiency across all linguistic abilities, encompassing listening, speaking, reading, and writing. Furthermore, this research offers a preliminary validation of the feasibility of implementing generative artificial intelligence within English education through specific instructional tasks such as syllabus creation, self-learning support, and pedagogical feedback from three aspects: educational subject, educational object, and educational process. Additionally, this paper delves into the merits of employing artificial intelligence in the realm of education, hoping to furnish more insights for future inquiries.},

  abstract={CNC controls are widely used in modern manufac-turing technology. They play a important role for the productivity of the machine they control. Already today, these controls are reaching their performance limits in certain scenarios. The controller acts like a performance bottleneck for increasingly dynamic machine tools. To further increase the performance of CNC controllers, this work proposes an novel method based on the use of generative adversarial networks (GAN) for the direct generation of tool paths within the CNC controllers. We present a concept that enables interpolation with GAN. Based on this, a novel system architecture for the integration of GAN into an AI-module within CNC controls is developed. The new method is evaluated on the basis of an example contour. GAN trained to generate linear toolpaths are used for evaluation. A smoothing GAN is used to blend the sharp path transitions between the generated path segments.},

  pages={87742-87766},
  abstract={Recommender Systems (RSs), which generate personalized content, have become a technological tool with diverse applications for users. While numerous RSs have been proposed and successfully implemented across various domains, traditional AI-based RSs still encounter certain challenges, such as data sparsity, cold start, and diversity. Generative Artificial Intelligence in recommender systems is a recent advancement used by platforms like Netflix, Spotify, and Amazon to recommend items, news, videos, audios, goods, and services to their customers/users or to personalize experiences for their customers/users. The main purpose of this review is to compare traditional AI-based recommender systems with generative AI-based recommender systems. A total of fifty-two (52) papers, published between 2019 and February 2024, were selected from six major online libraries. To get a more comprehensive understanding of the selected study, we reviewed the selected studies techniques, and the models, datasets, and metrics used. Our systematic review reveals that generative AI models, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs), variational autoencoder (VAEs) and autoencoders have been widely used in recommender systems and they perform better than traditional AI techniques. Among the 30 datasets analyzed, MovieLens was the most frequently used, accounting for 33%, while Amazon datasets accounted for 11%, Recall and RSME are the most commonly used metrics. Our literature review offers understandings into the Generative AI techniques used across different recommender systems and provides suggestions for the future research. Finally, we elaborated on open issues and discussed current and future trends in generative AI-based recommendation systems.},

  abstract={Modern 5G networks require complete rethinking of the network management and self-organizing functionality in order to provide extremely high quality of user experience across multi-tier coverage with different cells radius. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for the small cells coverage planning and performance optimization for multi-tier heterogeneous network based on the artificial intelligence (AI). We develop the AI plane in a way that knowledge is derived there and delivered to the each local SDN controller in a simplified form. Proposed approach allows to effectively train deep neural networks by using generative adversarial networks (GAN) for various topologies in conditions of limited amount of real data about network behavior and performance.},
