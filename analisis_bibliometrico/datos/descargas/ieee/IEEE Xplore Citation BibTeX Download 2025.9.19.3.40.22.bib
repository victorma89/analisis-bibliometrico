  abstract={The integration of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) into educational settings offers unprecedented opportunities to enhance the efficiency of teaching and the effectiveness of learning, particularly within online platforms. This study evaluates the development and application of a customized GAI-powered teaching assistant, trained specifically to enhance teaching efficiency for educators and improve learning outcomes for students in online education. Using four Grade 12 courses (i.e., English, Mathematics, Financial Accounting, and Simplified Chinese), we assessed the performance of generative pretrained transformer (GPT)-4, GPT-4o, and the Trained-GPT model. Results demonstrate that the Trained-GPT achieved grading accuracy and consistency comparable to human teachers, with strong correlations observed in Mathematics (0.996) and English (0.874). While GPT-4o performed well in specific cases, its variability highlights areas for improvement. These findings underscore the potential of AI-powered teaching assistants to streamline grading, deliver timely feedback, and support scalable, high-quality online education.},

  abstract={The gaming industry continually faces the challenge of high costs and extensive time requirements for producing 2D assets. Gaming studies hire and pay high costs to artists to create images for the game which is also time consuming. With the pervasive integration of artificial intelligence across various sectors, the application of AI in game development presents a promising solution to these challenges. This study focuses on the comparison and outcomes of two advanced generative AI tools, DALL-E and Midjourney, to reduce the time and cost associated with the creation of dynamic 2D game assets. The comparison process for both the AI tools involves creation of a Unity based game that integrates DALL-E and Midjourney to generate dynamic game assets which were used in the gameplay to get the user feedback inside the game. The findings reveal that both DALL-E and Midjourney significantly reduce the time and financial barriers traditionally associated with game asset creation, democratizing game development and allowing smaller studios to produce competitive content. DALL-E was found to be highly effective in rapidly transforming textual descriptions into high-quality visual assets, making it superior in terms of speed and cost-efficiency compared to Midjourney. Player feedback indicated a higher level of satisfaction and engagement with DALL-E-generated assets, particularly due to its superior performance in handling prompts and generating contextually relevant images.},

  pages={1-6},
  abstract={The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) has begun to reshape the creative landscape of filmmaking, particularly in the domain of screenwriting. Once relegated to speculative fiction, AI now emerges as a practical co-creator, offering tools capable of generating compelling narratives from minimal input. This study explores the evolving role of AI in screenwriting by evaluating story outputs generated by Bard AI against those written by human screenwriters. Using a structured, two-phase research design, the investigation compares the narratives based on five qualitative variables: plot, narration, character development, dialogue, and cultural relevance. A three-tiered input strategy—ranging from basic to extended prompts—was adopted to assess the AI's creative flexibility and responsiveness. Results show that while AI-generated stories demonstrate coherence, stylistic fluency, and efficient scene setting, they fall short in emotional depth, cultural nuance, and imaginative progression. Human-written scripts, though less structured, excel in dialogue and subtextual character portrayal. The findings highlight the potential of AI as a valuable tool in early-stage ideation and structural support, especially for Gen Z creators, while reaffirming the irreplaceable role of human imagination in storytelling. This research advocates for a hybrid screenwriting model, where AI serves as a creative assistant rather than a substitute for human authorship.},

  abstract={This paper examines the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Knowledge Management (KM), highlighting how AI reshapes traditional KM practices in organizations. It starts by reviewing historical KM frameworks, particularly the SECI model, which emphasizes the transformation between tacit and explicit knowledge. It differentiates generative AI from earlier AI models in terms of output nature, learning adaptability, and application scope. The study explores AI's potential to improve KM processes, focusing on how it influences social interactions, facilitates knowledge community development, and fosters collaborative intelligence by leveraging the strengths of both AI and human capabilities. AI's transformative role in KM includes enhancing knowledge creation, storage, and dissemination, accelerating processes like externalization and combination in the SECI model. However, the paper notes AI's current limitations in managing tacit knowledge and human-centric decision-making. The research underscores AI's capacity to streamline KM processes, improve efficiency, and unlock new opportunities for organizations. By integrating AI tools with human expertise, organizations can enhance their ability to manage, share, and apply knowledge, setting the stage for innovative approaches to knowledge-driven growth and decision-making in diverse contexts.},

  abstract={This work explores the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to improve research skills in engineering education, specifically at the time of conducting a Systematic Literature Review (SLR). While AI has previously been employed for basic tasks related to SLRs, such as relevant paper screening and classification within scope, there is still limited research on information retrieval from the full texts of scientific papers. This study focuses on the next phase in the SLR, which involves scientific documentary analysis. The methodology presented in this work compares the AI tools in the market to facilitate scientific documentary analysis and enhance and refine research skills in engineering students. Also, this paper addresses the challenges to automatically run documentary analysis during a SLR. To do so, several techniques to extract information from AIs are presented, including Application Programming Interfaces (API) or Graphical User Interfaces (GUI). According to the results, most of the AI tools have a limitation in the operations students can perform per day. Only PDFgear offers a no-cost solution with unlimited usage, while some other AI tools allow limited usage for not so high prize. In conclusion, this paper presents a contribution during the documentary analysis of a SLR. It is important to keep in mind the constraints associated with the limited usage of AIs, the accuracy of AI tools, or the complexity of the developed scripts for automating the process. Due to the rapidly changing market for artificial intelligence, the validity of this study is limited to the current state of the tools. Similar studies will be necessary as AI tools continue to evolve.},

  abstract={Image-generating AI provides diverse sources for ideation in fashion design education. This study explores how collaborative fashion ideation with AI influences image thinking and creativity in a changing media environment. The research method employed design workshops and in-depth interviews with 10 students. The findings reveal that collaborative fashion ideation with AI influences image thinking through visual expansion, exploration of its applicability in fashion, and identifying and lack of sociocultural understanding and identity in idea combination. Collaborative fashion ideation with AI emphasizes creative properties, such as originality, fluency, and flexibility. The results of design workshops, evaluated by experts, indicate higher originality and novelty compared to the control group. The results imply that various factors, such as individual aesthetic presence and the identity of fashion brands, contribute to fashion ideation. Therefore, in collaborative ideation with AI, rather than relying solely on AI tools, it is essential to perceive and approach them as auxiliary tools. This study contributes to elucidating students’ image thinking and creative attributes in fashion ideation, highlighting the impact of collaborative ideation with AI.},

AI inputs to deliberative processes may be perceived as more or less robust, accurate, or generalizable according to a range of factors that influence decision-makers. Then these habits and preferences might be reintroduced to the information loop in several ways, as the algorithm, the design/implementation process, and institutions adapt to accommodate the human element. Malicious actors are even likely to target this action-reaction loop to influence AI systems. This two-phase cycle is perhaps most worrisome in relation to cyber conflict, where informational ambiguity, functionally diverse workforces, and an expansive and fragmented threat environment combine to produce an immense opportunity for baking bias into the loop. This paper presents the results of two experiments designed to explore different manifestations of AI systems in the cyber conflict decision-making loop. Though findings suggest that technical expertise positively impacts respondents’ ability to gauge the potential utility and credibility of an input (indicating that training can, in fact, overcome decision-maker bias), the perception of human agency in the loop even in the presence of AI inputs mitigates this cautionary effect and makes decision-makers more willing to operate on less overall information.},

  abstract={In recent years, generative AI models such as ChatGPT, based on Transformer architectures, have developed rapidly and become a hot topic in society. They are widely used in programming, audio, and video processing fields, significantly enhancing productivity in these areas. However, various problems have also arisen during their application. At its core, generative AI still relies on symbolic formal logic and lacks the ability to simulate human cognitive patterns of understanding the world through prior logic or even dialectical logic. As such, it is impossible for these systems to achieve strong artificial intelligence as we know it. Currently, computer systems are founded on discrete mathematics and symbolic logic. This paper proposes an idea that combines prior logic theory with object-oriented programming techniques, using categorical judgment methods as a foundation to mimic human cognition patterns and discusses a possibility of approaching the realization of strong artificial intelligence.},

  abstract={Smart vehicles have gained attention as a key component of smart urban transportation system. Many individuals use smart cars and other private vehicles on a regular basis today. Artificial intelligence has emerged as an encouraging technology for improving driving safety and efficiency of smart vehicles. Data traffic of vehicular networks is anticipated to increase as a result of the development of variety of highly accurate and reliable sensor. By integrating artificial intelligence in vehicular networks, we can improve resource utilization and provide more safe and reliable services. The most significant issue with the usage of private transport is the rise of fatalities that result from road accidents; the energy cost and vehicle collision risks have been regarded as a significant issues. These issues make need to comprehensively review recent advancement in artificial intelligence and vehicular network. In this paper we have provided recent developments in vehicular network and artificial intelligence for enhancing the dependability, efficiency and safety of smart vehicles. This study provides a grasp of how artificial intelligence technologies are being used in vehicular network, new improvements in the current technologies and to explore new paradigms for future advances and challenges.},

  abstract={This paper presents the initial foundations of a new Global approach to Artificial Intelligence based on the modeling of global intelligence and the development of artificial cooperative systems to support this. The research work brings numerous investigations and some recent creations to develop intelligent systems in urgent global, cooperative domains. The investigations present an overall view of current issues like true natural i.e. global intelligence. The creations include several results in global solutions explorations as well as new models, services, architectures and processes which could be of special interest for global organizations that urgently need to achieve intelligent cooperation. The major aim of the approach is to help these organizations, and other related institutions, to succeed in their complex daily duties where true thinking, more natural intelligence and new global artificial systems are required. Further, the paper provides some guidelines for the next evolutions of the work in the form of a brief, open research agenda and, some general actions for deploying Global Artificial Intelligence into our organizations, suggesting how to build new global artificial intelligent systems in real and virtual ecosystems.},

  abstract={The paper is devoted to the study of capabilities of generative artificial intelligence as a technology to support hearing-impaired students in inclusive programs at a technical university of the general type. The study was carried out within the frame of teaching natural science discipline “Chemistry” and socio-cultural ones (“Cultural Studies” and “Sociology”). It involved all types of educational activities and resources for all kinds of classes in these disciplines. It was found that effectiveness of applying artificial intelligence to support these students in mastering disciplines is determined mainly by specifics of a their educational and rehabilitation background. Research has confirmed that generative artificial intelligence can be a good assistant to students only provided that they have developed verbal and so called “21st century skills”: critical and analytical thinking, mastering complex content and working in digital environments.},

  abstract={In this paper, we present the results achieved by performing a test addressed to evaluate the capabilities of the so-called AI content Detectors or AI Detection Systems. Such systems promise to find out whether a given text was written by a human or created by an artificial intelligence (AI). The ability to identify the “synthetic” nature of a text is paramount in many workplaces as well as in the educational field, where we focused our research. More specifically, we considered the academic environment and the frequent request by faculty to students to write term papers on a wide variety of topics. Then, it is essential for teachers to be able to evaluate content quality as well as their authenticity. Until now, anti-plagiarism tools have been widely used to verify that homework assignments were not copied, but the recent advent of generative artificial intelligence-based tools changed the game, moving the focus to automatic generation. In both cases, we are facing a violation of the educational pact by a student, versus a teacher, if not outright an offence. Conversely, an unfounded accusation of fraud by a teacher toward a student would be equally serious. Therefore, to use automatic detection tools one must have a guarantee on the reliability of their output.},

  abstract={Summary <p>Enterprises need to be aware of the new risks that come with using generative artificial intelligence (AI) and tackle them proactively to reap the benefits. Generative AI introduces completely new risk categories and changes our established risk management approach. Generative AI introduces a new risk category of intentional malicious usage of generative AI. Alongside the positive productivity impact of generative AI usage for approved use cases, threat actor productivity is also growing at an unprecedented rate. The AI usage layer covers user accountability and data governance for generative AI application. Users need to be aware of the security, privacy, and ethical implications of using generative AI, as well as the potential threats of AI&#x2010;based attacks. The AI application security layer focuses on application design and safety systems. The AI application layer is the interface between the user and the generative AI.</p>},
