The area known as algorithmic music composition concerns the research on processes of composing music pieces automatically by a computer system. The use of AI for algorithmic music consists on the application of AI techniques as the main tools for the composition generation. There are several models of AI used in music composition such as: heuristics in evolutionary algorithms, neural networks, stochastic methods, generative models, agents, decision trees, declarative programming and grammatical representation. In this survey we present the trending in techniques for automatic music composition. We summarized several research projects of the last seven years and highlight the directions of music composition based on AI techniques.},

 abstract = {Today, numerical controls (CNC) are the standard for the control of machine tools and industrial robots in production and enable highly flexible and efficient production, especially for frequently changing production tasks. A numerical control has discrete inputs and outputs. Within the NC channel, however, it is necessary to analytically describe curves for the calculation of the position setpoints and the jerk limitation. The resulting change between discrete and continuous description forms and the considerable restrictions in the parallelisation of the interpolation of continuous curves within the NC channel lead to a performance overhead that limits the performance of the NC channel with regard to the calculation of new position setpoints. This can lead to a drop in production speed and thus to longer production times. To solve this problem, we propose a new approach in this paper. This is based on the use of deep generative models and allows the direct generation of interpolated toolpaths without calculation of continuous curves and subsequent discretization. The generative models are being trained to create curves of certain types such as linear and parabolic curves or splines directly as discrete point sequences. This approach is very well feasible with regard to its parallelization and reduces the computing effort within the NC channel. First results with straight lines and parabolic curves show the feasibility of this new approach for the generation of CNC toolpaths.},

 abstract = {Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, as the core technology in Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications, such as self-driving vehicles, make important decisions by performing a variety of data classification or prediction tasks. Attacks on data or algorithms in AI applications can lead to misclassification or misprediction, which can fail the applications. For each dataset separately, the parameters of ML algorithms should be tuned to reach a desirable classification or prediction accuracy. Typically, ML experts tune the parameters empirically, which can be time consuming and does not guarantee the optimal result. To this end, some research suggests an analytical approach to tune the ML parameters for maximum accuracy. However, none of the works consider the ML performance under attack in their tuning process. This paper proposes an analytical framework for tuning the ML parameters to be secure against attacks, while keeping its accuracy high. The framework finds the optimal set of parameters by defining a novel objective function, which takes into account the test results of both ML accuracy and its security against attacks. For validating the framework, an AI application is implemented to recognize whether a subject's eyes are open or closed, by applying k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) algorithm on her Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. In this application, the number of neighbors (k) and the distance metric type, as the two main parameters of kNN, are chosen for tuning. The input data perturbation attack, as one of the most common attacks on ML algorithms, is used for testing the security of the application. Exhaustive search approach is used to solve the optimization problem. The experiment results show k = 43 and cosine distance metric is the optimal configuration of kNN for the EEG dataset, which leads to 83.75% classification accuracy and reduces the attack success rate to 5.21%.},

 abstract = {In Recent years, Representation learning as one of the information extraction and data mapping methods in machine learning systems has received huge attention. Artificial deep neural networks are considered as one of the basic structures capable of representation learning. However, a large number of standard representation learning methods are supervised and requires a lot of labeled data. In this paper, we introduce an unsupervised representation learning by designing and implementing deep neural networks (DNNs) in combination with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The main idea behind the proposed method, which causes the superiority of this method over others is representation learning via the generative models and encoder networks altogether. In this research, encoders are utilized in addition to the generative models to help the more features to be extracted. It is shown that the proposed method not only help feature extraction but accelerate and improve the performance of the learning in GANs which lead to better feature extraction. The results confirm the superiority of the proposed approach regarding classification accuracy by 2% to 6% improvement over other unsupervised feature learning methods.},

Already today, these controls are reaching their performance limits in certain scenarios. The controller acts like a performance bottleneck for increasingly dynamic machine tools. To further increase the performance of CNC controllers, this work proposes an novel method based on the use of generative adversarial networks (GAN) for the direct generation of tool paths within the CNC controllers. We present a concept that enables interpolation with GAN. Based on this, a novel system architecture for the integration of GAN into an AI-module within CNC controls is developed. The new method is evaluated on the basis of an example contour. GAN trained to generate linear toolpaths are used for evaluation. A smoothing GAN is used to blend the sharp path transitions between the generated path segments.},

 abstract = {Night vision technology provides an important means for night observation by using infrared radiation of the target as the imaging basis. Recently, artificial neural network (ANN) has become a research hotspot. Realizing the classification and recognition of infrared images by ANN is helpful to the intelligent development of night vision technology, as well as improve the accurate judgment of the surrounding environment by unmanned vehicles at night, and better ensure the safety of people and vehicles. However, the existing infrared image data set contains a small number of images, and the types of scenes and targets presented in the images are single, which cannot support the training of ANN. ANN cannot obtain the classification function of infrared images through full learning. In this paper, an infrared image generative model based on generative adversarial network (GAN) is proposed, which can convert the existing visible light data set into the infrared version of the data set in a short time, and then solve the problem of lack of infrared image data sets. To train ResNet by infrared version data set can realize its classification function for infrared images. The model with the existing image generative model is compared through several evaluation indexes. The results show that the model is more effective in generative infrared images. Inputting ImageNet data set into this model can generate ImageNet infrared version data set. ResNet trained by this data set has a classification and recognition accuracy of 91.28%, which is higher than the experimental results of existing image generative models. The design and implementation of infrared image generative model in this paper promote the application of artificial intelligence and depth learning in night vision technology and other fields.},

The generative adversarial network is introduced into the noise interference suppression algorithm.Based on the improved generative adversarial network model, the VLF noise interference suppression algorithm is studied. The generation model with strong learning ability is used to improve the accuracy of expected signal frequency estimation in the spectrum of noisy signal, and further improve the signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio in the signal bandwidth. The experimental results show that, by training the generative adversarial network, the received signals in the direction of - 45° to 45° of the receiving antenna show good noise reduction effect, and the accuracy rate can reach above 90%.},

As an experiment for the evaluation of imitated motion images, we performed experiments with our collaborators. Then, we asked the collaborators for their opinions about real and imitated motion images. The results suggest that the imitated motion images are more effective.

 abstract = {Purpose
This study examines consumers' evaluations of product consumption values, purchase intentions and willingness to pay for fashion products designed using generative adversarial network (GAN), an artificial intelligence technology. This research investigates differences between consumers' evaluations of a GAN-generated product and a non-GAN-generated product and tests whether disclosing the use of GAN technology affects consumers' evaluations.
Design/methodology/approach
Sample products were developed as experimental stimuli using cycleGAN. Data were collected from 163 members of Generation Y. Participants were assigned to one of the three experimental conditions (i.e. non-GAN-generated images, GAN-generated images with disclosure and GAN-generated images without disclosure). Regression analysis and ANOVA were used to test the hypotheses.
Findings
Functional, social and epistemic consumption values positively affect willingness to pay in the GAN-generated products. Relative to non-GAN-generated products, willingness to pay is significantly higher for GAN-generated products. Moreover, evaluations of functional value, emotional value and willingness to pay are highest when GAN technology is used, but not disclosed.
Originality/value
This study evaluates the utility of GANs from consumers' perspective based on the perceived value of GAN-generated product designs. Findings have practical implications for firms that are considering using GANs to develop products for the retail fashion market.},
