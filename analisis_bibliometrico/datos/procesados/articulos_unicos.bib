    abstract = {The imbalanced dataset is a challenging issue in many classification tasks. Because it leads a machine learning algorithm to poor generalization and performance. The imbalanced dataset is characterized as having a huge difference between the number of samples that contain each class. Unfortunately, various resampling methods are proposed to solve this problem. In our work, we target enhancing the handling of the imbalanced dataset using a new oversampling technique based on generative adversarial neural networks. Our method is benchmarked against the widely used oversampling technique including the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE), random oversampling technique (ROS), and the adaptive synthetic sampling approach(ADSYN). Additionally, three machine learning algorithms are used for evaluation. The outcome of our experiments on a real-world credit card dataset shows the strong ability of the proposed solution against the competitive oversampling techniques to overcome the imbalanced problem in the European credit card dataset.},

    abstract = {We are in a golden age of progress in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). Radiotherapy is perfectly suited to benefit from AI to enhance accuracy and efficiency due to its technology-intensive nature and direct human–machine interactions. While large amount of AI research have recently been published in the field of photon therapy, applications of AI specifically targeted for particle therapy remain scarcely investigated. There are two distinct differences between the photon therapy and particle therapy: 1) beam interaction physics (photons versus charged particles) and 2) beam delivery mode (e.g., IMRT/VMAT versus pencil beam scanning). Consequently, different strategies of AI deployment are required for these two radiotherapy modalities. In this article, we aim to present a comprehensive survey of recent literature exclusively focusing on AI-powered particle therapy. Six major aspects are included: 1) treatment planning; 2) dose calculation; 3) range and dose verification; 4) image guidance; 5) quality assurance; and 6) adaptive replanning. A number of perspectives, as well as potential challenges and common pitfalls, are also discussed.},

However, we developed the mobile app, namely Smart UEnglish with the smart mechanisms by integrating multiple recognition technologies and artificial intelligence (AI) to help learners practice meaningful English writing in authentic contexts. Through the smart mechanisms like the integration of speech-to-text (STR), image-to-text recognition (ITR), and generative-AI, the learners could receive not only lexical resources but also sample sentences generated by AI (AI-GS) to inspire them to make meaningful writing. A total of 71 undergraduate students from two classes were assigned to two groups. The experimental group (EG) learns with Smart UEnglish including ITR, STR, and AI-GS. Meanwhile, the control group (CG) learns with ITR and STR only. The mix-method was used to analyze the study deeply. The results found that the EG outperformed the CG in the posttest. The ITR-generated texts as input for AI-GS could inspire the learners by giving the sample sentences before they write the essay. The use of ITR is the predictive variable in the post-test. In addition, the learners in EG have high positive perceptions towards Smart UEnglish. Hence, the integration of multiple recognition technologies and AI in the Smart UEnglish could facilitate EFL learners to learn meaningful writing in authentic contexts.},

In the past six to seven years, the amount of computing power used by record-breaking AI models doubled frequently in the time span of months. An interesting way in which these models learn and progress is through deep learning. Deep learning is an intelligent machine’s way in which machines learn without being supervised by us and grants them the power to recognize speech, translate, and even make or take data-driven decisions. Machines consider this as a studying method, inspired by the architecture of the human brain and how we learn. An important deep learning method where we train the machines on information that is unlabeled is called unsupervised learning. A strong part of neural networks that are utilized for unsupervised learning is Generative Adversarial Networks. When it comes to applications on images quality improvement, Super Resolution GAN (SRGAN) have a key role to play in it. It was proposed by researchers at Twitter. The motive of this GAN is to super resolute the fine textures of the image by upscaling it. In order to enhance the images further, ESRGAN is used. As the name suggests, ESRGAN is an implementation of SRGAN and uses some added components of SRGAN.},

However, when it comes to culture and creativity, many social and political cost factors should be taken into account. It is crucial to identify the opportunities that AI can offer in terms of the preservation, use, promotion, and accessibility of Cultural Heritage (CH). However, ethical concerns should be outlined when applying AI in cultural settings, such as for the digital replica of official UNESCO heritage sites or an unbiased explanation and interpretation of a work of art. This paper provides a first attempt to define the main ethical findings on this topic and propose it as an ethical framework to assess different risks arising from the use of AI in the CH domain. The application of this disruptive technology in the arts is evaluated through the lens of ethical principles for trustworthy AI and it explores whether the wider accessibility and improved preservation techniques enabled by AI come at some cost in terms of interpretation, social and cultural inclusion, subjectivism, or other forms of bias. The main ethical principles that emerge from the literature for the application of AI in the cultural domain are the following: Shared Responsibility, Meaningful Participation, Explainability, Accessibility, Sustainability, Reliability and Dignity. The findings underline the importance of establishing specific sectoral ethical guidelines for AI in the field of tangible and intangible CH to support and enhance its sustainable development without compromising its values, significance, sense of belonging and strong social impact.},

For a remarkable amount of time, researchers have tried to solve the black-box issue by using modular additions, which have led to the rise of the term: interpretable artificial intelligence. As the literature matured (as a result of, in particular, deep learning), that term transformed into explainable artificial intelligence (XAI).

One promising development in this field is the use of generative artificial intelligence technology, such as the ChatGPT conversational agent. Chatbot technology has the potential to revolutionize the way educational content is accessed, created, understood, and implemented. In this research paper, we examine the current state of AI-powered chatbots in education and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using chatbots in this context. A case study of an AI unit planner (Copilot) built on top of the GPT-3 application in K-12 settings will also be presented, examining how chatbots are used to assist teachers in lesson design and the extent to which teachers are familiar with them. Finally, the implications of chatbot technology for the future of education are discussed, along with recommendations for future research directions.},

    abstract = {Interest has been growing over the past number of years in the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to aid in cancer diagnosis. However, the requirement for extensive training data to train these AI models presents a significant challenge. This paper proposes a viable solution to this issue by synthesising images to augment the real data in the training dataset. We investigate the potential of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in generating high-quality tissue images for both colon and prostate. The datasets we use are from the TCGA repository and contain various cancerous diseases for both colon and prostate. We outline how the data was pre-processed, and quality controlled and we also delineate the relevant experiments applied. We apply some of the most recent GAN architectures in ProGAN and StyleGAN to generate synthetic colon tissue images, achieving a literature-high Fréchet Inception Score (FID) score of 6.019 for colon tissue images and an FID score of 3.03 for prostate tissue images. Notably, the synthetic images produced were deemed indistinguishable from real samples when assessed by a practicing consultant histopathologist. By addressing the challenge of limited training data, our approach could ultimately contribute to earlier detection and improved treatment outcomes for cancer patients worldwide.},

The rPPG signal is extracted through the periodic changes of the facial skin in the facial video. The rPPG signal extracted by most existing rPPG methods has low quality, and it only can be used for average heart rate (HR) and respiratory rate (RR), etc. But for the field of heart rate variability (HRV) analysis, higher quality rPPG signals are needed. This paper introduces a novel and efficient generative adversarial network method defined as rPPGGAN, which denoises and enhances the original rPPG signal extracted by a deep learning rPPG method to make it closer to the real rPPG signal. The HRV indicators were verified on the public datasets UBFC-rPPG and PURE, and both the time-domain indicators and frequency-domain indicators have been effectively improved. The method proposed in this paper is lightweight, efficient, and easy to integrate. It can effectively improve the rPPG signal quality after being integrated with other rPPG methods.},

    abstract = {Lifelong learning describes an ability that enables humans to continually acquire and learn new information without forgetting. This capability, common to humans and animals, has lately been identified as an essential function for an artificial intelligence system aiming to learn continuously from a stream of data during a certain period of time. However, modern neural networks suffer from degenerated performance when learning multiple domains sequentially and fail to recognize past learned tasks after being retrained. This corresponds to catastrophic forgetting and is ultimately induced by replacing the parameters associated with previously learned tasks with new values. One approach in lifelong learning is the generative replay mechanism (GRM) that trains a powerful generator as the generative replay network, implemented by a variational autoencoder (VAE) or a generative adversarial network (GAN). In this article, we study the forgetting behavior of GRM-based learning systems by developing a new theoretical framework in which the forgetting process is expressed as an increase in the model’s risk during the training. Although many recent attempts have provided high-quality generative replay samples by using GANs, they are limited to mainly downstream tasks due to the lack of inference. Inspired by the theoretical analysis while aiming to address the drawbacks of existing approaches, we propose the lifelong generative adversarial autoencoder (LGAA). LGAA consists of a generative replay network and three inference models, each addressing the inference of a different type of latent variable. The experimental results show that LGAA learns novel visual concepts without forgetting and can be applied to a wide range of downstream tasks.},

As the different GenAI models like ChatGPT and Google Bard continue to foster their complexity and capability, it’s critical to understand its consequences from a cybersecurity perspective. Several instances recently have demonstrated the use of GenAI tools in both the defensive and offensive side of cybersecurity, and focusing on the social, ethical and privacy implications this technology possesses. This research paper highlights the limitations, challenges, potential risks, and opportunities of GenAI in the domain of cybersecurity and privacy. The work presents the vulnerabilities of ChatGPT, which can be exploited by malicious users to exfiltrate malicious information bypassing the ethical constraints on the model. This paper demonstrates successful example attacks like Jailbreaks, reverse psychology, and prompt injection attacks on the ChatGPT. The paper also investigates how cyber offenders can use the GenAI tools in developing cyber attacks, and explore the scenarios where ChatGPT can be used by adversaries to create social engineering attacks, phishing attacks, automated hacking, attack payload generation, malware creation, and polymorphic malware. This paper then examines defense techniques and uses GenAI tools to improve security measures, including cyber defense automation, reporting, threat intelligence, secure code generation and detection, attack identification, developing ethical guidelines, incidence response plans, and malware detection. We will also discuss the social, legal, and ethical implications of ChatGPT. In conclusion, the paper highlights open challenges and future directions to make this GenAI secure, safe, trustworthy, and ethical as the community understands its cybersecurity impacts.},

Motivated by the high-accuracy decision-making capabilities of artificial intelligence, this article aims to highlight the effectiveness of artificial intelligence applications in the areas of virus detection, health monitoring, face mask detection, crowd sensing, and satellite-based environment monitoring. One of the most promising deep learning techniques presented in the literature is the convolutional neural network (CNN) that has shown remarkable classification accuracy. The reason for using artificial intelligence in this area is the inherent difficulty of these applications such as detecting COVID-19 infections using lung images due to its resemblance with other respiratory diseases. While the lack of sufficient training data is considered one of the main difficulties, it has been alleviated with the aid of specialized artificial intelligence techniques such as generative adversarial networks and transfer learning. Satellite-based imagery along with deep learning have shown an improvement in the air quality due to the imposed mobility restrictions during the pandemic. Apart from the technical challenges, some applications faced social and ethical challenges that are mainly related to the patient privacy. The latter factor have made dataset availability more limited, and restricted the implementation of some applications such as contact tracing.

It not only can be simultaneously with a variety of styles but also fully express the design concept. However, the manual completion of the fusion design process takes time and effort. With the development of artificial intelligence, some designers apply intelligent algorithms to fusion design and significantly improve design efficiency. However, most design methods only achieve style migration from the source domain product style to the target domain product in one direction, leading to the resulting design solution losing some of the style information of the target domain product. We propose a color-style fusion design method based on generative adversarial networks. Take the eyeshadow color design as an example. Firstly, the source domain art painting dataset and the target domain eyeshadow dataset are collected, and the CycleGAN extracts the color styles of both to fuse to generate an eyeshadow color scheme with artistic style. The experimental results show that the proposed method can meet the color design concept of color cosmetics and retain the original art painting color style, providing a reference for designers and a new idea for product fusion design.},

In order to provide a detailed overview of the efforts, this article pays particular attention to these developments by highlighting key application areas of data-driven AI in education; it also analyzes existing tools, research trends, as well as limitations of the role data-driven AI can play in education. In particular, this article reviews various applications of AI in education including student grading and assessments, student retention and drop-out predictions, sentiment analysis, intelligent tutoring, classroom monitoring, and recommender systems. This article also provides a detailed bibliometric analysis to highlight the salient research trends in AI in education over nine years (2014–2022) and further provides a detailed description of the tools and platforms developed as the outcome of research and development efforts in AI in education. For the bibliometric analysis, articles from several top venues are analyzed to explore research trends in the domain. The analysis shows sufficient contribution in the domain from different parts of the world with a clear lead for the United States. Moreover, students' grading and evaluation have been observed as the most widely explored application. Despite the significant success, we observed several aspects of education where AI alone has not contributed much. We believe such detailed analysis is expected to provide a baseline for future research in the domain.},

Integration of AI in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can lead to tremendous growth in the field of UAVs by improving flight safety and efficiency. Machine learning algorithms can enable UAVs to make real-time decisions in complex environments and reach the optimal solution that aims to fulfill a mission's requirements within the hardware constraints such as battery and payload. Several recent works in UAVs employed a variety of machine learning algorithms to enhance the capabilities of UAVs and assist them. Although several reviews have been published examining the various aspects of AI for UAVs, they are all pertaining to particular applications or technologies. Addressing this research gap, we present a comprehensive and diversified review to enable researchers to analyze the current and future requirements and develop the latest solutions utilizing AI. We have classified the reviewed works based on three different classification schemes: 1) application scenario-based, 2) AI algorithm-based, and 3) AI training paradigm-based. We have also presented a compilation of frameworks, tools, and libraries used in AI-integrated UAV systems. We identified that the integration of AI in UAVs has a wide array of applications ranging from path planning to resource allocation. We have observed that Reinforcement Learning based algorithms are more often used in AI-integrated UAV systems than other AI algorithms. Further, our findings reveal that UAV frameworks employing federated learning and other distributed machine learning paradigms are quickly emerging. Furthermore, we also have put forth several challenges and potential applications of AI-integrated UAV systems.},

The study of explainable AI (XAI), which is an active research field that aims to make AI systems results more understandable to humans, has been called for by this dilemma. This is a field with great hopes for improving the trust and transparency of AI-based systems and is considered a necessary route for AI to move forward.

However, such services will encounter high latency because of data transmission and a high volume of user requests. On the other hand, edge-cloud computing can provide adequate computation power and low latency at the same time through the collaboration between edges and the cloud. Thus, it is attractive to build GenAI systems at scale by leveraging the edge-cloud computing paradigm. In this overview paper, we review recent developments in GenAI and edge-cloud computing, respectively. Then, we use two exemplary GenAI applications to discuss technical challenges in scaling up their solutions using edge-cloud collaborative systems.

Now that GAI is becoming widespread, it is necessary to distinguish GAI from human intelligence, which constitutes knowledge. The data, information, knowledge, and work (DIKW) hierarchy is a useful framework for teaching and for checking metacognitive and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) literacy. There are two types of collaboration between GAI and human intelligence: a combined intelligence model and a parallel intelligence model. The combined intelligence model is a method of using GAI for creating works by collecting data, organizing information, and deriving knowledge from information. This model is suitable for GAI-assisted tasks (GAIATs). The parallel intelligence model is suitable for GAI-assisted learning (GAIAL); it is a method in which a person develops abilities by analyzing and comparing tasks created by GAI after going through the data-information-knowledge-work process. The zone of proximal development (ZPD) created by educational scaffolding is a quantitative framework that is appropriate for evaluating the effects of GAI.

Choosing the appropriate weights is an involved process, that ranges from using trial and error to using sophisticated machine learning algorithms. In this paper, we proposed a novel technique that uses generative adversarial networks to customize the weights used for each individual input to the ensemble. Specifically, we propose to use conditional generative adversarial networks to generate the weights, with the input image acting as the label to the network and the appropriate weight being the output. We test the proposed system on an image classification task and show that the proposed method produces better results than using fixed weights by 2.43 percent.},

For example, generating SQL sentences that are capable of detecting a cyber-attack from a set of metrics available in a database table. Two solutions are needed to achieve so, a tool that enables and performs the syntactically valid generation of SQL sentences and an (Artificial intelligence) AI algorithm able to guide the semantics of such generations to the achievement of the best sentences for the intended purpose. The main contribution of this manuscript is the first of these solutions. To be concrete, this paper proposes a tool to enable and generate syntactic-valid language sentences. The tool can deal with any language defined as an ANTLR4 EBNF (Extended Backus-Naur Form) grammar. The paper also provides a methodology to help achieve an EBNF grammar suitable for addressing concerns related to ambiguity and recursion as a direct result of the generation process. The paper further implements a prototype utilizing ANTLR4’s recognizer and its Augmented Transition Network for language generation using EBNF grammars. In-depth design and logic implementation are provided, showcasing areas of interest for AI integration. The achieved prototype showed an ability to easily generate syntactically valid SQL statements at various depths, with observable problems becoming more apparent during the exponential recursive growth. Our mitigation controls for such scenarios proved to be successful and were able to complete the recursion whilst also moving the push-down automata forward until query completion. Experimental validation was performed against a SQL EBNF grammar feeding the generated SQL statement into an SQL parser to validate the syntax.},

With the advantages of low latency and privacy-preserving, serving PFMs of mobile AI services in edge intelligence is a viable solution for caching and executing PFMs on edge servers with limited computing resources and GPU memory. However, PFMs typically consist of billions of parameters that are computation- and memory-intensive for edge servers during loading and execution. In this article, we investigate edge PFM serving problems for mobile AIGC services of the metaverse. First, we introduce the fundamentals of PFMs and discuss their characteristic fine-tuning and inference methods in edge intelligence. Then, we propose a novel framework of joint model caching and inference for managing models and allocating resources to satisfy users’ requests efficiently. Furthermore, considering the in-context learning ability of PFMs, we propose a new metric to evaluate the freshness and relevance between examples in demonstrations and executing tasks, namely the Age of Context (AoC).

    abstract = {As artificial intelligence becomes increasingly popular, so too does the frequency it is attacked. One area where artificial intelligence models are being embraced heavily is avionics, where it is used in a variety of areas including intrusion detection, surveillance, radar, navigation, and more. These networks are vulnerable to a number of attacks, one of which being the adversarial attack. Adversarial attacks aim to perturb the input to the image classification model, which can lead to output misclassifications, lowering the overall model accuracy. This paper will demonstrate how such an attack can lower the accuracy of a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on an aircraft image dataset. The perturbed inputs will be generated by a generative adversarial network (GAN) trained on the same dataset as the CNN. GANs consist of two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator. The generator will continually create new images based off of the dataset, while the discriminator decides whether or not the image is generated or from the reference dataset. This forms a feedback loop, where the generator continues to improve based on the output of the discriminator. Once trained, the outputs of the GAN will be used to misclassify the trained CNN in an attempt to lower the model’s accuracy. Following this, adversarial defenses such as feature squeezing and random smoothing will be discussed. These defenses attempt to mitigate the damage done by an attack, usually by adapting the model, modifying the input, or modifying the data the model is trained on. This can cause the accuracy of the model to slightly fall from its original accuracy, but with the benefit of being more resilient to adversarial attacks. We analyze this tradeoff and highlight the advantages of adversarial training in learning-enabled avionics systems.},

Currently, our approach to NPD has remained largely unchanged for decades, yielding stubbornly poor results: only 30% of NP development projects become commercial successes. However, the AI revolution is set to alter this landscape significantly! Leading early adopter firms demonstrate that AI not only finds many applications in NPD but also offers substantial payoffs, such as 50% reductions in development times. This article provides an outline of the diverse and powerful applications of AI in NPD, offering numerous examples from leading companies. Examples include GE's use of digital models and twins to quickly test product designs in turbine development; BASFs use of AI to identify new molecules for use in customer formulations; and AI to generate new-product ideas, identify new-product opportunities, and even create new-product concepts. Our exploratory journey begins at the idea stage and traverses the entire new-product process to the postlaunch period. While AI might still resemble science fiction to many, that future is no longer fiction—it is here now. AI has arrived in full force! With an adoption window of about 13 years, the time is now to embrace AI in NPD in your business. AI will become a major milestone in NPD, perhaps the most important, within the decade.},

    abstract = {Despite the advancements that have come out of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom and subsequent generative AI race, there are a significant number of problems under the surface. With the rise of AI generators in social media and pop culture, these problems amplify as the demand for AI tools skyrockets. These solutions regularly exhibit harmful biases and stereotypes deeply embedded in the data developers use to train AI models. Perhaps exacerbating the immediacy of the issue, generative AI models can create highly realistic imagery, empowering users with malicious intent. This paper explores the pervasive issue of bias in generative AI and its implications. It also examines how these models, often trained on biased datasets, can unintentionally amplify, replicate, and reinforce harmful biases and stereotypes. Additionally, it delves into the objectification of individuals, particularly women, and in a novel study, discusses how a popular TikTok filter that uses generative AI exhibits gender and racial biases while excessively sexualizing its users. While research on AI bias is forthcoming, existing literature referenced throughout this paper underscores its presence across various systems. This paper demonstrates the continued propagation of AI bias as these systems expand and iterate, often with inadequate mitigation efforts. It advocates for ethical considerations, accountability, and transparency in generative AI design and data selection. The Author proposes a novel framework called the Stereotypes, Objectification, Racism, and Datasets (SORD) Framework. The SORD Framework is proposed as a lens to examine the multifaceted dimensions of bias in generative AI. By critically analyzing these components, this paper aims to shed light on the ethical implications of biased generative AI, stimulate thoughtful discussions regarding responsible AI development, and provoke the lengthy process of removing bias from the systems and training datasets to eliminate AI bias at the source. Furthermore, it calls for collaboration among developers, researchers, and engineers to advance research, mitigate biases, and promote algorithmic fairness using the SORD Framework. Future work includes refining the SORD framework and assessing its effectiveness. Lastly, the Author underscores the pivotal role of engineering education in nurturing ethical AI practices, empowering future engineers to address societal challenges stemming from biased datasets and AI systems.},

Cultural heritage preservation and education have increasingly turned to Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies to enhance learning experiences and promote the understanding and appreciation of diverse artistic expressions. We have conducted an initial empirical study on how ChatGPT can assist learners in analysing and interpreting poetic and lyrics works, offering insights into the historical, cultural, and literary significance embedded within the verses. Our findings highlight ChatGPT's significant potential but also major weaknesses with respect to poetry and lyrics. ChatGPT was found particularly good in the field of interpreting poetic content. Additionally, ChatGPT showed a very good performance in analogy identification, demonstrating a broad knowledge base encompassing various form of poetry, from Ancient Greek works to ecclesiastic hymns and modern compositions. However, opportunities for enhancement are evident in translation and historical context provision. Finally, ChatGPT's weakest aspect was its factual accuracy, occasionally producing errors without indicating uncertainty in its responses. Consequently, while ChatGPT displays substantial promise, its application in e-learning settings is not mature due to observed inaccuracies. Furthermore, we introduced MUSILYAN, a specialised software tool designed for musicological and lyrical analysis, complementing ChatGPT's capabilities. While Chat-GPT excels in natural language understanding and generation, MUSILYAN offers structured semantic content management and thematic organisation of lyrics.

    abstract = {Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a pervasive disorder affecting millions of individuals, presenting a significant global health concern. Functional connectivity (FC) derived from resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rs-fMRI) serves as a crucial tool in revealing functional connectivity patterns associated with MDD, playing an essential role in precise diagnosis. However, the limited data availability of FC poses challenges for robust MDD diagnosis. To tackle this, some studies have employed Deep Neural Networks (DNN) architectures to construct Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) for synthetic FC generation, but this tends to overlook the inherent topology characteristics of FC. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN)-based Conditional GAN with Class-Aware Discriminator (GC-GAN). GC-GAN utilizes GCN in both the generator and discriminator to capture intricate FC patterns among brain regions, and the class-aware discriminator ensures the diversity and quality of the generated synthetic FC. Additionally, we introduce a topology refinement technique to enhance MDD diagnosis performance by optimizing the topology using the augmented FC dataset. Our framework was evaluated on publicly available rs-fMRI datasets, and the results demonstrate that GC-GAN outperforms existing methods. This indicates the superior potential of GCN in capturing intricate topology characteristics and generating high-fidelity synthetic FC, thus contributing to a more robust MDD diagnosis.},

    abstract = {Proper artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) model implementation and training are highly reliant on quality input data. However, the high costs of clinical studies and increasing privacy concerns limit the availability of medical data to researchers. This work explores the potential of applying generative adversarial networks (GAN) for generating synthetic medical data based on publicly available real-world datasets. Synthetic data is generated based on real-world observations and used to train several contemporary ML and AI models. These models are subjected to comparison with models trained on real data. Both trained models are evaluated under identical conditions on real-world testing data. These well-known, high-quality datasets are explored in this study covering diabetes and heart disease. While models trained on synthetic data show a slight decrease in objective performance, they still demonstrate viably accurate outcomes. This suggests that the introduced approach presents a potential stepping stone towards improvising data availability for researchers while respecting patients’ best interests and patient privacy.},

The world has been gripped by technology, and the advances that are being made every day are undeniably transforming the planet. In the domains of Big Data, engineering, and data science, this cutting-edge technology is ready to support us. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a current research topic because it can be applied to a wide range of applications and disciplines to solve complicated problems and find optimal solutions. In research, medicine, technology, and the social sciences, the benefits of AI have already been proven. Data science, also known as pattern analytics and mining, is a technique for extracting useful and relevant information from databases, enabling better decision-making and strategy formulation in a range of fields. As a result of the exponential growth of data in recent years, the combined notions of big data and AI have given rise to many study areas, such as scale-up behaviour from classical algorithms. Furthermore, combining numerous AI technologies from other areas (such as vision, security, control, and biology) in order to build efficient and durable systems that interact in the real world is a new problem. Despite recent improvements in fundamental AI technologies, the integration of these skills into larger, trustworthy, transparent, and maintainable systems is still in its development.

    abstract = {This research paper explores the use of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) techniques to create synthetic medical datasets that balance data realism and privacy preservation. The sensitivity of medical records poses challenges for data access and sharing, making GAI a promising solution. The study evaluates five key approaches—StyleGAN2, CLIP, T5, ViT, and specialized Tabular GANs—across three critical dimensions: distribution fidelity, attribute correlation preservation, and pattern recognition accuracy. The results reveal the strengths and limitations of each technique in generating realistic medical data. StyleGAN2, CLIP, and T5 excel in all dimensions, making them ideal for various applications requiring high-quality synthetic medical datasets. ViT shows promise but may need fine-tuning for specific use cases, while specialized Tabular GANs demonstrate potential but vary in performance. This comparative analysis provides valuable insights for researchers and practitioners at the intersection of Generative AI and healthcare data generation. It underscores the potential of Generative AI in addressing the tabular data generation challenge in medical records, offering realistic and privacy-conscious alternatives for data utilization and model training.},

    abstract = {As we transition from the 5G epoch, a new horizon beckons with the advent of 6G, seeking a profound fusion with novel communication paradigms and emerging technological trends, bringing once-futuristic visions to life along with added technical intricacies. Although analytical models lay the foundations and offer systematic insights, we have recently witnessed a noticeable surge in research suggesting machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) can efficiently deal with complex problems by complementing or replacing model-based approaches. The majority of data-driven wireless research leans heavily on discriminative AI (DAI) that requires vast real-world datasets. Unlike the DAI, Generative AI (GenAI) pertains to generative models (GMs) capable of discerning the underlying data distribution, patterns, and features of the input data. This makes GenAI a crucial asset in wireless domain wherein real-world data is often scarce, incomplete, costly to acquire, and hard to model or comprehend. With these appealing attributes, GenAI can replace or supplement DAI methods in various capacities. Accordingly, this combined tutorial-survey paper commences with preliminaries of 6G and wireless intelligence by outlining candidate 6G applications and services, presenting a taxonomy of state-of-the-art DAI models, exemplifying prominent DAI use cases, and elucidating the multifaceted ways through which GenAI enhances DAI. Subsequently, we present a tutorial on GMs by spotlighting seminal examples such as generative adversarial networks, variational autoencoders, flow-based GMs, diffusion-based GMs, generative transformers, large language models, autoregressive GMs, to name a few. Contrary to the prevailing belief that GenAI is a nascent trend, our exhaustive review of approximately 120 technical papers demonstrates the scope of research across core wireless research areas, including 1) physical layer design; 2) network optimization, organization, and management; 3) network traffic analytics; 4) cross-layer network security; and 5) localization & positioning. Furthermore, we outline the central role of GMs in pioneering areas of 6G network research, including semantic communications, integrated sensing and communications, THz communications, extremely large antenna arrays, near-field communications, digital twins, AI-generated content services, mobile edge computing and edge AI, adversarial ML, and trustworthy AI. Lastly, we shed light on the multifarious challenges ahead, suggesting potential strategies and promising remedies. Given its depth and breadth, we are confident that this tutorial-cum-survey will serve as a pivotal reference for researchers and professionals delving into this dynamic and promising domain.},

GAI models like ChatGPT, DALL-E, and Bard have recently caught the attention of industry and academia equally. GAI applications span various industries like art, gaming, fashion, and healthcare. In healthcare, GAI shows promise in medical research, diagnosis, treatment, and patient care and is already making strides in real-world deployments. There has yet to be any detailed study concerning the applications and scope of GAI in healthcare. Addressing this research gap, we explore several applications, real-world scenarios, and limitations of GAI in healthcare. We examine how GAI models like ChatGPT and DALL-E can be leveraged to aid in the applications of medical imaging, drug discovery, personalized patient treatment, medical simulation and training, clinical trial optimization, mental health support, healthcare operations and research, medical chatbots, human movement simulation, and a few more applications. Along with applications, we cover four real-world healthcare scenarios that employ GAI: visual snow syndrome diagnosis, molecular drug optimization, medical education, and dentistry. We also provide an elaborate discussion on seven healthcare-customized LLMs like Med-PaLM, BioGPT, DeepHealth, etc.,Since GAI is still evolving, it poses challenges like the lack of professional expertise in decision making, risk of patient data privacy, issues in integrating with existing healthcare systems, and the problem of data bias which are elaborated on in this work along with several other challenges.

This cognitive ability enhances their grasp of the content and augments their overall enjoyment. Consequently, the development of an automated system aimed at producing visually faithful images based on textual descriptions, often referred to as the text-to-image task, stands as a profoundly meaningful endeavor. For this reason, a variety of text-to-image generating artificial intelligences (AIs) have been devised until now. Nevertheless, the generative AIs introduced thus far encounter an issue wherein they struggle to uphold the coherence of input sentences, particularly when multiple sentences are provided. Within this paper, we present a remedy to this challenge through the application of prompt editing. Furthermore, our experimental results substantiate that our proposed solution more effectively preserves contextual coherence among the generated images in comparison to other preexisting generative artificial intelligence models. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme improves performance by at least 30 percent in terms of the similarity of the generated image and by 130 percent in terms of  $ROUGE_{recall}$ .},

The field of education has also been greatly impacted by this transformative technology, with researchers exploring the applications of generative AI, particularly ChatGPT, in education. However, existing research primarily focuses on generating text from text, and there remains a relative scarcity of studies on leveraging multimodal generation capabilities to address key challenges in multimodal data supported instruction. In this article, we present a technical framework for generating Tang poetry situational videos, emphasizing the utilization of generative AI to address the need for multimedia teaching resources. Our framework comprises three main modules: textual situational comprehension, image creation, and video generation. Moreover, we have developed a situational video generation system that incorporates various technologies, including text-to-text generation models, text-to-image generation models, image interpolation, text-to-speech synthesis, and video synthesis. To ascertain the efficacy of the modules within the Tang poetry situational video generation system, we undertook a comparative analysis utilizing the prevalent text-to-image and text-to-video generation models. The empirical findings indicate that our approach is capable of generating images that exhibit greater semantic similarity with the poems, thereby enabling a better comprehension of the poem's connotations and its key components. Concurrently, the Tang poetry videos generated can significantly contribute to the reduction of cognitive load and the enhancement of understanding during the learning process. Our research showcases the potential of generative AI in the education field, specifically in the domain of multimodal teaching resources.},

This article investigates a potential threat from adversarial AI in blind false data injection attacks (FDIA) targeting the ac state estimators in the smart grid. Assuming no access to the grid topology required in most FDIA, we propose an adversarial model based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) to infer grid topology from historical measurements. Following the topology inference, a substitute bad data detector (BDD) model is further proposed in the attack model to filter the false data before injection, reducing the risk of detection given potential bad data in normal operations. We also refine the common evaluation of FDI stealthiness by including the presence of bad data among normal and false data when assessing the detection performance. Simulations on the IEEE 30-bus system reveal that significant deviations can be inflicted stealthily by the proposed blind FDI attack. Detailed analyses of the stealthiness, impacts, and parameters are also presented to shed more light on the threats for further studies and effective countermeasures.},

The batch processing and high efficiency characteristics of AI technology are adopted and derivative design is taken as a medium to effectively disseminate black copper patterns infused with silver. Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) models from deep learning are employed and tuned with appropriate parameters. The deep learning framework realizes the generation of black copper patterns infused with silver. Furthermore, by incorporating image style transfer algorithms, novel pattern aesthetics are designed while preserving the distinctive features of black copper patterns infused with silver. Expert assessments through questionnaire responses reveal that the average rating for the visual aesthetics of the images is 4 points, with a high score of 4.08 for style simulation effectiveness, and a presentation rating of 3.67 for Yunnan's cultural connotation. Expert reviews show approval for the migration results in the experiment, as the transferred pattern designs satisfy aesthetic preferences and meet the standards for simulating different styles. This work provides valuable insights for the preservation and inheritance of black copper patterns infused with silver, as well as for promoting their diversified applications.},

    abstract = {Generative models are an important class of models in the field of artificial intelligence. Unlike models that aim to establish a mapping between inputs and outputs by extracting features, the goal of generative models is to learn the distribution of training data and generate new samples with similar features from a latent space. In the development of generative models, efforts have been made to improve the diversity of generated samples, progressing from VAE (variational auto-encoders). VAE achieves random sampling and generation of diverse images by transforming the bottleneck layer of the encoder from predicting low-dimensional feature maps to predicting positions sampled from a normal distribution. Subsequently, vector quantized variational autoencoders(VQ-VAE) and VQ-VAE-2 models were introduced, followed by the first-generation DALL-E model, and then diffusion models. We will discuss the basic principles of each model, the strengths and weaknesses of the models, and the innovations introduced by each model compared to its predecessors. After that, an overview of the evaluation metrics specific to generation models is provided. Finally, the applications that generation model enables are summarized. This review provides creative ideas for the future development of generative models.},

This method is used to pre-trained models on large datasets and can be used for various tasks without requiring training from scratch. Training SR3 from scratch using the ImageNet dataset involves a complex process that requires substantial computational resources and expertise. The idea is applied the trained SR3 model to new images by feeding the low-resolution inputs and obtaining the high-resolution outputs. It's important to note that training SR3 from scratch is a resource-intensive process that requires powerful GPUs and significant computation time. If you do not have access to such resources, an alternative is to use pre-trained models that are already available and fine-tune them on specific datasets or tasks. The paper shows the result of comparing the resolution of the preprocessed images using a significantly smaller number of images to perform the training with those obtained using the pre-trained model. The results obtained show acceptable results without having to perform on large datasets minimizing the computation time to obtain the resolution of images.},

In this study, a human-centered learning and teaching framework that uses generative AI tools for self-regulated learning development through domain knowledge learning was proposed to catalyze changes in educational practices. The framework illustrates how generative AI tools can revolutionize educational practices and transform the processes of teaching and learning to become human-centered. It emphasizes the evolving roles of teachers, who increasingly become skillful facilitators and humanistic storytellers who craft differentiated instructions and attempt to develop students’ individualized learning. Drawing upon insights from neuroscience, the framework guides students to employ generative AI tools to augment their attentiveness, stimulate active engagement in learning, receive immediate feedback, and encourage self-reflection. The pedagogical approach is also reimagined; teachers equipped with generative AI tools and AI literacy can refine their teaching strategies to better equip students to meet future challenges. The practical application of the framework is demonstrated in a case study involving the development of Chinese language writing ability among primary students within a K–12 educational context. This article also reports the results of a 60-h development programme for teachers. Specifically, providing in-service teachers with cases involving uses of the proposed framework helped them to better understand the generative AI concepts and integrate them into their teaching and learning and increased their perceived ability to design AI-integrated courses that would enhance students’ attention, engagement, confidence, and satisfaction.},

    abstract = {The recent rapid development of generative artificial intelligence (AI), and the resulting market growth, has introduced new challenges for social responsibility, an area where companies may need more guidance. In this regard, the literature covers a broad spectrum, from the impact of bias to the potential use of this technology to implement undemocratic surveillance. Another focus area discusses the AI industry's commitment to human rights and social responsibility, examining the diverse actors involved in this commitment and the context-dependent nature of their impact on human rights. This work performs a systematic review and a comparative analysis of the strategies and actions taken by four leading companies—OpenAI, Meta AI Research, Google AI, and Microsoft AI—with respect to five critical dimensions: bias, privacy, cybersecurity, hate speech, and misinformation. Our study analyzes 192 publicly available documents and reveals that depending on the diversity of products and their nature, some companies excel in the research and development of technologies and methodologies for privacy preservation and bias reduction, offering user-friendly tools for managing personal data, establishing expert groups to research the social impact of their technologies, and possessing significant expertise in tackling hate speech and misinformation. Nonetheless, there is an urgent need for greater linguistic, cultural, and geographic diversity in research lines, tools, and collaborative efforts. From this analysis, we draw a set of actionable best practices aimed at supporting the responsible development of AI models, and foundation models, in particular, that are aligned with human rights principles.},

Although existing AIGC-based AI Agent systems can solve simple tasks, it is complicated to handle complex tasks due to inconsistent work logic. In this research, the operating mechanism of AI Agents was dissected to elucidate why AIGC is suitable as the foundation for AI Agents. Based on this technology, we proposed an AI Agent framework named SOP-GPT which has integrated the concept of Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) from human workflow into AI Agents. SOP-GPT comprises three main elements: process, role, and skills. By combining the generative capability of AIGC with human SOP mechanisms, the quality of generation was enhanced to meet the expectations of human work requirements. We further explored how to assemble an AIGC engineering process for the division of labor and collaboration methods between various functional departments or units in enterprises in this framework. This research results provide a perspective for human management experience to enhance the capabilities of AI Agents and provide direction for future research.},

    abstract = {This research work presents a groundbreaking approach at the intersection of neuroscience and generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), focusing on the application of neuroscience techniques to neural networks, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs). Central to this study is the concept of ‘neural cluster knockout’ in LLMs, a method inspired by lesion studies in neuroscience involving the systematic removal of neuron clusters to decipher their role within the model. The research underscores the opaque nature of neural networks, particularly LLMs, which are often critiqued for their ‘black box’ operation. By adopting neuroscience principles, particularly lesion studies, this paper aims to illuminate the inner workings of neural networks, enhancing our understanding of their functionalities. This is crucial in an era increasingly reliant on AI in various sectors, where insights from this study could lead to the development of more efficient, transparent, and accountable AI systems. Methodologically, this study involved Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and neural cluster knockout through iterative zeroing, applied to the Large Language Model named LLaMA. This approach enabled the identification of significant neuron clusters and their functional impacts when deactivated. The results reveal both critical and redundant neurons within LLMs, demonstrating that some clusters are vital for accuracy, while others may impede efficiency or contribute to errors. This research contributes significantly to the AI field, offering a novel perspective on the intricate architecture of LLMs. It lays a foundation for future advancements in AI, envisioning refined and efficient LLMs capable of more accurate and reliable performance.},

How do we teach students to use AI models and tools responsibly, thoughtfully, and ethically, while being aware of their capabilities and limitations? In this article, we share insights from integrating generative AI tools and machine learning (ML) models into a project-based undergraduate tangible and embodied interaction (TEI) course by employing co-creation processes. TEI is an evolving area within human–computer interaction, which focuses on integrating computation into our daily physical environments and objects, thus fostering an embodied, multisensory, and often collaborative interaction experience. We use the term co-creation to describe a process, where humans and AI work together to create new artifacts or solve a problem. We integrated structured co-creation activities into various phases of the project including ideation, conceptual design, and prototyping. We describe practical ways and learning goals for integrating emerging generative AI tools and ML models into the project design process, provide insight on how novice interaction designers iterate and collaborate with generative AI and ML models, and reflect on the merits and limitations of using generative AI tools and ML models for project-based interaction design courses for pervasive computing.},

While numerous RSs have been proposed and successfully implemented across various domains, traditional AI-based RSs still encounter certain challenges, such as data sparsity, cold start, and diversity. Generative Artificial Intelligence in recommender systems is a recent advancement used by platforms like Netflix, Spotify, and Amazon to recommend items, news, videos, audios, goods, and services to their customers/users or to personalize experiences for their customers/users. The main purpose of this review is to compare traditional AI-based recommender systems with generative AI-based recommender systems. A total of fifty-two (52) papers, published between 2019 and February 2024, were selected from six major online libraries. To get a more comprehensive understanding of the selected study, we reviewed the selected studies techniques, and the models, datasets, and metrics used. Our systematic review reveals that generative AI models, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs), variational autoencoder (VAEs) and autoencoders have been widely used in recommender systems and they perform better than traditional AI techniques. Among the 30 datasets analyzed, MovieLens was the most frequently used, accounting for 33%, while Amazon datasets accounted for 11%, Recall and RSME are the most commonly used metrics. Our literature review offers understandings into the Generative AI techniques used across different recommender systems and provides suggestions for the future research. Finally, we elaborated on open issues and discussed current and future trends in generative AI-based recommendation systems.},

    abstract = {This work explores the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to improve research skills in engineering education, specifically at the time of conducting a Systematic Literature Review (SLR). While AI has previously been employed for basic tasks related to SLRs, such as relevant paper screening and classification within scope, there is still limited research on information retrieval from the full texts of scientific papers. This study focuses on the next phase in the SLR, which involves scientific documentary analysis. The methodology presented in this work compares the AI tools in the market to facilitate scientific documentary analysis and enhance and refine research skills in engineering students. Also, this paper addresses the challenges to automatically run documentary analysis during a SLR. To do so, several techniques to extract information from AIs are presented, including Application Programming Interfaces (API) or Graphical User Interfaces (GUI). According to the results, most of the AI tools have a limitation in the operations students can perform per day. Only PDFgear offers a no-cost solution with unlimited usage, while some other AI tools allow limited usage for not so high prize. In conclusion, this paper presents a contribution during the documentary analysis of a SLR. It is important to keep in mind the constraints associated with the limited usage of AIs, the accuracy of AI tools, or the complexity of the developed scripts for automating the process. Due to the rapidly changing market for artificial intelligence, the validity of this study is limited to the current state of the tools. Similar studies will be necessary as AI tools continue to evolve.},

Recent trends show that the next digital transformation will directly impact the way people live, communicate, work, trade and learn and will be powered by artificial intelligence (AI). Generative artificial intelligence has had to face significant higher education challenges since its appearance, requiring the development of new and innovative teaching and learning practices. Nevertheless, the assimilation of such immersive technologies necessarily brings with it many challenges, advantages, and risks, which have led to differing opinions among educators, students, and academics. This paper provides a preliminary reflection on the risks and benefits that higher education students perceive in the formal use of this type of tool for academic purposes. An exit survey was used to verify the initial opinions of the students, obtaining almost 90 percent of positive perceptions, but only considering AI as a support tool. In contrast, a significant percentage mentioned that there could be some risks in using this technology: dependency on AI tools, loss of creativity and plagiarism according to institutional policies. Despite its innovative and significant importance, the students acknowledge that the tool is imperfect and accept several disadvantages, such as incorrect answers, poor quality references and the production of unsafe content, so its use must regulate and for now remain only as a complementary support tool.},

This paper addresses the crucial question of whether to impose restrictions or legislate the usage of Gen-AI, with ChatGPT as a pivotal case study. Through systematic literature review and frequency of occurrence analysis, 10 ethical concerns were selected for further analysis using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). The analysis responses of 10 expert panels show that the top concerns, as revealed by their weights, after meeting the consistency requirement, include copyright, legal, and compliance issues (0.1731), privacy and confidentiality (0.1286), academic integrity (0.1206), incorrect reference and citation practices (0.1111), and safety and security concerns (0.1050). Evaluating the impact of these concerns on the policy alternatives (restriction and legislation), the findings revealed that “Restriction” received a higher weight (0.513712) compared to “Legislation” (0.485887). Notably, copyright, legal, and compliance issues, privacy and confidentiality, and academic integrity emerged as crucial factors influencing the decision between restriction and legislation. This study offers valuable insights for educational institutions and policymakers, suggesting the need for inclusive discussions, pilot programs to assess impacts on critical thinking, development of clear guidelines, flexible regulatory frameworks, awareness campaigns, and potential strategies for ethical and responsible use.},

    abstract = {Test-Driven Development (TDD) is an agile software development approach. It promotes short cycles, composed of three phases each, to incrementally implement software functionality: Red, Green, and Refactor. In the Red Phase, the TDD developer writes a unit test for a small chunk of functionality not yet implemented and watches the test fail. In the Green Phase, the TDD developer writes production code to make the test pass as quickly as possible. Finally, in the refactor phase, the TDD developer “cleans” written code. In this demo paper, we present GAI4-TDD (Generative Artificial Intelligence for Test-Driven Development), a PyCharm plugin to support the Green Phase of TDD. Specifically, this plugin generates production code from the tests the TDD developer had written in the Red Phase so that the generated code makes these tests pass. Previous studies have shown that TDD can be beneficial not only in the “traditional” software development context but also in the Embedded Systems (ESs) development context. We preliminary assessed GAI4-TDD in the latter context through a laboratory empirical study on three ESs. We observed that in the greater part of the cases, GAI4- TDD generates production code that successfully implements the chunk of functionality required.

In modern industry, IoT plays a pivotal role by monitoring the condition of industrial machines and, consequently, improving the efficiency of industrial processes. To optimize the efficiency of industrial IoT applications, various Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques have been adopted, leading to a new computing paradigm, namely, Industrial Artificial Intelligence of Things (i.e. Industrial AIoT). In this paper, we describe the challenges to tackle and the opportunities to explore in Industrial AIoT. Specifically, we first review the use of state-of-the-art AI methods in Industrial AIoT applications, with a focus on Deep Learning (DL) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. Thereafter, we present a series of important applications of Industrial AIoT. The key challenges associated with the implementation of Industrial AIoT applications are also discussed. In addition, the societal and economic impacts of Industrial AIoT are briefly described. Finally, we outline the future research directions in Industrial AIoT, which should be further investigated to fully utilize the potential of this innovative technology.},

    abstract = {Generative diffusion models (GDMs) have emerged as potent tools for generating high-quality, creative content across various media, including audio, images, videos, and 3-D models. Their application in artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) marks a pivotal advancement in the evolution from the Internet of Things (IoT) to the Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT). Considering the inherent multiple-access nature of AIoT, training GDMs via federated learning and deploying them collaboratively is paramount. However, such approaches introduce considerable security risks and energy consumption challenges. To address these issues, we propose a comprehensive architecture for GDMs, encompassing both training and sampling stages. This architecture, termed secure and sustainable diffusion (SS-Diff), aims to thwart trigger-based security threats, such as backdoor attacks and trojan attacks, while simultaneously reducing energy consumption in multiple-access AIoT. The SS-Diff architecture incorporates a dynamic quantization mechanism within the training phase, significantly reducing communication overhead and thereby improving both spectrum and energy efficiency. During the sampling stage, a detection-based defense strategy is employed to identify and negate trigger inputs associated with malicious attacks. Through extensive simulations, we evaluate the performance of the SS-Diff architecture. The results demonstrate that the SS-Diff can effectively train GDMs and eliminate the impact of the attacks, compared with existing schemes.},

In industrial production, however, limitations are still present that hinder application online and in a series that goes beyond isolated use cases. One crucial issue is data precondition, i.e., data quality, consistency, and labeling. As DCAI addresses these issues, developments in this field have caught the attention of various experts. In summary, DCAI continues to be an exciting and promising field of study that enhances AI applicability. Several research works have been conducted in DCAI, but unfortunately, no comprehensive reviews have been conducted to summarize and highlight the results. This gap in knowledge inspired our work, that aims to answer well-structured research questions. The focus of this paper is to clarify the terminology used in DCAI while also distinguishing it from other AI-related problems. This helps to analyze the current standards and problems associated with DCAI. This paper summarizes current use cases of DCAI and their impact on industries.

The engineering of SoS, or System of Systems Engineering (SoSE), presents unique challenges that necessitate novel approaches for design, integration, and management for connecting systems into SoS. Additionally, SoS capabilities can be further leveraged using the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI), which has yet to be fully explored. This paper introduces an innovative framework leveraging AI to address the complex demands of SoSE. The framework itself has been developed using a systematic domain analysis method. The framework incorporates a metamodel, a Matrix Chart for aligning AI technologies with specific SoS capabilities, and a systematic method for their application across different stages of the SoS lifecycle. To validate our framework, we employ a multi-case study methodology, examining diverse SoS examples across industries. These case studies demonstrate the practicality and impact of the presented proposed AI-driven approach in real-world SoSE challenges.

Consumer electronics like smartphone and tablet use digital technologies to enhance human’s entertainment and health. The creation of digital content or data augmentation sometimes requires using generative artificial intelligence technologies. Although data generation systems have been successfully used in some consumer products, it is still challenging to create a powerful generative system due to the complexity of input signals and the difficulty of model training. In this paper, a multistage evolutionary generative adversarial network (GAN) framework is proposed to alleviate the above challenges. The multistage evolutionary GAN is a general framework and can be instantiated to existing evolutionary GAN and its variants. Moreover, this paper designs a two-stage and a three-stage evolutionary GAN methods. The two models show that different variation operators and evaluation methods can be used in different stages. Experiments are conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets. The results show that the proposed methods are effective in capturing complex input signals and alleviating the model training problem. The proposed methods can greatly facilitate the application of image generation systems in consumer products.},

It identifies and highlights the role of different stakeholders (university management, students, staff, etc.) during the adoption process. It also proposes an objective approach based upon an evaluation matrix to assess the success and outcome of the GenAI adoption. Background: Universities worldwide are debating and struggling with the adoption of GenAI in their curriculum. GenAI has impacted our perspective on traditional methods of academic integrity and the scholarship of teaching, learning, and research. Both the faculty and students are unsure about the approach in the absence of clear guidelines through the administration and regulators. This requires an established framework to define a process and articulate the roles and responsibilities of each stakeholder involved. Research Questions: Whether the academic ecosystem requires a methodology to adopt GenAI into its curriculum? A systematic approach for the academic staff to ensure the students’ learning outcomes are met with the adoption of GenAI. How to measure and communicate the adoption of GenAI in the university setup? Methodology: The methodology employed in this study focuses on examining the university education system and assessing the opportunities and challenges related to incorporating GenAI in teaching and learning. Additionally, it identifies a gap and the absence of a comprehensive framework that obstructs the effective integration of GenAI within the academic environment. Findings: The literature survey results indicate the limited or no adoption of GenAI by the university, which further reflects the dilemma in the minds of different stakeholders. For the successful adoption of GenAI, a standard framework is proposed 1) for effective redesign of the course curriculum; 2) for enabling staff and students; and 3) to define an evaluation matrix to measure the effectiveness and success of the adoption process.},

The primary purpose of this research is to examine and understand the factors influencing user acceptance and behavioral intentions towards generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in the design field. To achieve this, this research delineates a multifaceted theoretical model, underpinned by an analysis of user behavioral intentions and their driving factors. The model encapsulates eight principal constructs: intention to continue use, self-efficacy, perceived usefulness, satisfaction, facilitating conditions, expectation confirmation, trust in technology, and social influence. An empirical examination of 13 related hypotheses was conducted. Utilizing data from 339 valid questionnaires, the outcomes of the structural equation modeling lent support to all posited hypotheses. The research delineates that users’ sustained intention to utilize generative AI technology is directly contingent upon factors such as perceived usefulness, satisfaction, self-efficacy, and trust in technology. Notably, perceived usefulness and self-efficacy are identified as pivotal determinants of satisfaction. Furthermore, social influence and expectation confirmation are found to augment perceived usefulness, while facilitating conditions to enhance both self-efficacy and expectation confirmation.

    abstract = {This article presents a controlled case study focused on implementing and using generative artificial intelligence, specifically large language models (LLMs), in physiotherapy education to assist instructors with formulating effective technology-mediated feedback for students. It outlines how these advanced technologies have been integrated into an existing feedback-oriented platform to guide instructors in providing feedback inputs and establish a reference framework for future innovations in practical skills training for health professions education. Specifically, the proposed solution uses LLMs to automatically evaluate feedback inputs made by instructors based on predefined and literature-based quality criteria and generates actionable textual explanations for reformulation. In addition, if the instructor requires, the tool supports summary generation for large sets of text inputs to achieve better student reception and understanding. The case study describes how these features were integrated into the feedback-oriented platform, how their effectiveness was evaluated in a controlled setting with documented feedback inputs, and the results of its implementation with real users through cognitive walkthroughs. Initial results indicate that this innovative implementation holds great potential to enhance learning and performance in physiotherapy education and has the potential to expand to other health disciplines where the development of procedural skills is critical, offering a valuable tool to assess and improve feedback based on quality standards for effective feedback processes. The cognitive walkthroughs allowed us to determine participants' usability decisions in the face of these new features and to evaluate the perceived usefulness, how this would integrate into their workload, and their opinion regarding the potential for the future within this teaching strategy. This article concludes with a discussion of the implications of these findings for practice and future research directions in this developing field.},

Generative artificial intelligence is an artificial intelligence system capable of generating texts, images, and other media based on the input training data. Although still in their early stages, numerous examples of such systems in different domains have gained widespread attention from the public, media, policymakers, and researchers. This study aims to explore the generative AI academic research in the past decade using bibliometrics, text analysis, and social network analysis. Specifically, research themes and their relationships, the evolution of research themes over time, and prominent authors, articles, journals, institutions, and countries publishing in generative AI are identified. The data was further found to partially support the classical bibliometrics laws of Zipf, and Bradford’s. The two overarching research themes identified using knowledge synthesis from most cited articles and journals are technical advancements and developments in generative AI systems; and their applications to image processing, pattern recognition, and computer vision. ChatGPT, large language models, and the application of generative AI to healthcare and education are emerging research topics. Additionally, generative AI’s usefulness to geoscience, remote sensing, Internet of Things (IoT), and cybersecurity are discussed.},

To this end, the tactile Internet has been proposed as a medium that provides the sense of touch ability, facilitating data transferability with extra-low latency in various applications ranging from industry, robotics, and healthcare to road traffic, education, and culture. Here, programmable networks are role players in approaching the tactile Internet’s low latency (≈ 1ms) pillar. Several functionalities – including security – are offloaded onto the network core employing programmable in-network pipelines. From the security perspective, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is another role player that enables the line-rate inference on the core network without involving the control plane. However, integrating AI-based security solutions in programmable devices is challenging mainly because of their constrained anatomy. Furthermore, such solutions inherit well-known adversarial AI vulnerabilities, representing an additional threat to programmable networks. Considering the above, this article discusses AI-based security solutions in programmable networks, focusing on the explored modalities of integrating AI models in programmable constrained network devices. Moreover, we elaborate on the challenges and risks of relying on AI for such mechanisms. Lastly, the article brings a visionary glimpse for future trends in this regard, raising some essential questions on the indispensability of AI for security functionalities and providing some alternative solutions.},

Video interviews will be released for free, and responses will be synthesized to share meaningful and insightful commonalities and responses. In addition, a list of the resources discussed in the interview will be cataloged alongside the videos and indexed for the site in its entirety.

Despite its potential, understanding the factors driving its adoption and how that affects social sustainability remains underexplored. This study aims to address this gap by integrating AI attributes (“perceived anthropomorphism,” “perceived intelligence,” and “perceived animacy”) with the theory of planned behavior and the technology-environmental, economic, and social sustainability theory (T-EESST) to develop a theoretical research model. Utilizing a hybrid structural equation modeling and artificial neural network approach, we analyzed data collected from 1048 university students to evaluate the developed model. Our findings revealed that while perceived behavioral control has an insignificant impact on generative AI use, attitudes emerge as the most critical factor, further reinforced by the significant role of subjective norms. Perceived anthropomorphism, perceived intelligence, and perceived animacy were also found to influence students’ attitudes significantly. More importantly, the findings supported the role of generative AI in positively affecting social sustainability, aligning with the principles of T-EESST. This study's significance lies in its holistic examination of the interplay between technological attributes, motivational aspects, and sustainability outcomes, offering valuable insights for various stakeholders.},

    abstract = {In order to inspire future researches and practices regarding the use of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) in education, this study conducted a literature review on AIGC in education. The study found that using AIGC in teaching and learning brings unprecedented opportunities for digital transformation in education, including providing technical support for the enhancement of personalized learning, empowering the cultivation of higher-order cognitive skills, and transforming educational assessment to reshape teaching and learning. Nevertheless, the application of AIGC in education may involve risks such as cognitive biases, ethical concerns, and widening the digital divide. To address the risks, coping strategies have been proposed by researchers, including strengthening the capability of providing reliable AIGC services, developing ethical guidelines for AIGC in education, and promoting teachers’ and students’ digital literacy. However, the existing studies mainly focused on theoretical analyses, and practical researches of AIGC in education is still limited. Based upon the literature review, the authors put forward future research directions for reference.},

Computer vision is an emerging discipline, and applying generative artificial intelligence technology to image processing is an important entry point in current machine vision research. When generating images, this article utilized adversarial learning mechanisms to optimize the parameters of the generator and discriminator, creating a competitive relationship between the two and gradually improving the quality of the generated images. Adversarial training methods were used in video processing to optimize the generated model, enabling it to map between different styles and achieve style transfer. The generative adversarial network was optimized using a cyclic consistency loss function to ensure consistency of video content before and after editing. Based on the trained recurrent generative adversarial network, style transformation and content editing on the video were performed. The PSNR value of generated image 3 was 27.1; the PSNR (peak signal-to-noise ratio) value of the original image was 27.8; the SSIM (Structural Similarity) value of the generated image was 0.95; the SSIM value of the original image was 1.00. The PSNR and SSIM values of the generated image with image number 3 in the experiment were relatively high and close to the corresponding values of the original image.

First up, we're using GANs to make medical images sharper and more useful. Thinkof it like giving doctors super-clear glasses to spot details that might be hard to see otherwise. Then, we're using AIML to predict diseases by looking at these images and other patient info. It's like having a crystal ball that helps doctors catch problems before they get serious.

It's like having an assistant who reads all the details and pulls out the most important parts, making it easier for doctors to decide what's next. By bringing together these technologies, we're not just making diagnoses more accurate and predicting diseases sooner, but we're also making sure doctors get the key info they need quickly.

To ensure image fidelity, skip connections are introduced between the encoder and decoder. Meanwhile, we introduce a targeted training methodology designed to mitigate fluctuations in network parameters, thereby maximizing the efficacy of the model’s training velocity. We additionally conducted comparative evaluations based on the GoPro and Kohler datasets, contrasting our model against previously proposed algorithms to approve its exceptional performance in deblurring efficacy and efficiency.},

In order for the users to be safe using social media we have to ensure that the governance aspects also include fake news detection. Many of the fake news detection techniques utilize Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) and more recently Generative AI (GenAI) techniques. Therefore, the AI systems that implement the various techniques have to be trustworthy. That means these systems have to be secure as well as ensure fairness, privacy and integrity. Therefore, the paper will also discuss AI Governance as an integral part of Social Media Governance. Finally, to support the various applications and frameworks, both data and the cloud are critical. Large amounts of data are stored and managed by the social media systems as well as used to train the AI models.

    abstract = {As technology develops day by day, significant developments have been made in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). In particular, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), as the main technologies that form the basis of artificial intelligence, have offered revolutionary innovations and laid the foundation for future technologies. Traditional artificial intelligence models are based on algorithms that show high performance in certain tasks such as classification, scoring, prediction, and pattern recognition. These algorithms are developed to best perform a specific task, making it difficult for artificial intelligence to be sufficiently effective in areas that require flexibility. Generative artificial intelligence, which has become widespread in recent years, has the ability to produce certain types of content in addition to the competencies of traditional artificial intelligence models. This has revolutionized the field of productivity in artificial intelligence. Generative artificial intelligence language models have gone beyond the limitations and started a new era in artificial intelligence applications. Where traditional artificial intelligence models are limited, language models have come into play, especially with their natural language processing (NLP) capabilities. Rather than just analyzing data, language models can learn the rules of the language and provide human-like responses, produce text, and offer a wider range of applications. In this way, artificial intelligence systems have become more flexible, extensible, and dynamic. With the rise of language models in this field, concepts such as large language models (LLM) and small language models (SLM) have emerged. Large language models have come to the fore as systems that can provide deep knowledge and language production on a wide variety of topics by being trained on huge data sets. Large language models such as ChatGPT are one of the most common and impressive examples in this field. However, small language models, which are smaller and specialized language models, have begun to be used as an alternative to large language models in certain areas because they require less data and processing power. Small language models stand out with their lighter but targeted performance, offering effective solutions, especially in situations where there are resource limitations. At this point, using both large and small versions of language models in the right scenarios provides great advantages in terms of sustainability and efficiency. This study aims to reveal the transformative effect of technology on artificial intelligence and the critical role of language models in this process by evaluating language models and the issues to be considered in the selection of these models.},

The growing popularity and use of AI systems calls for a new understanding of what it means to be literate in the modern world. Thus, it is crucial for individuals to develop AI-driven critical thinking skills to effectively interact with these technologies. However, existing research focuses mainly on the "how" of AI integration, with limited exploration of the "why" and "how" of fostering critical engagement with AI tools. In this article, we propose an extension to DigCompEdu that aligns with the UNESCO pillars of education. This extension highlights five key elements that challenge critical thinking capabilities in relation to AI: "know-what," "know-who," "know-where," "know-how," and "know-why". By combining critical thinking skills with AI functionalities, educators can empower students to become responsible and informed digital citizens in the era of generative AI.},

    abstract = {The manufacturing sector is in a challenging spot. Confronted with persistent cost pressures, supply chain instability, and disruptive technologies like as 3D printing and the Internet of Things. The industry must consistently optimise processes, enhance efficiency, and improve overall equipment performance. Simultaneously, there is a significant surge in sustainability and energy transition. Manufacturers are being urged to decrease their carbon emissions, embrace circular economy principles, and enhance their overall environmental sustainability. Manufacturers are under pressure to consistently innovate while still assuring stability and safety. An erroneous AI forecast in a marketing campaign may cause small inconvenience, whereas an erroneous AI forecast on a manufacturing shopfloor can have catastrophic consequences. Manufacturers are familiar with technology and disruption, but the main issue is that what is effective in principle often proves unsuccessful in practice. As producers, we have established a knowledge base; nevertheless, it is difficult for users to locate information efficiently as it requires extensive time and effort to search and navigate through the contents. Alternatively, we can establish a data lake that may rapidly deteriorate into a data swamp. Alternatively, we can continue to incorporate other applications, so perpetuating the growth of our technological debt. However, we are now incapable of updating our applications due to the presence of intricate and long-standing logic within them. The implementation requirements and applications of generative artificial intelligence differ from those of analytical AI. Analytical artificial intelligence (AI) is widely used for the purposes of predicting future events, optimising desired values, and utilising past data to enhance processes and results. Gen AI represents a new opportunity for problem solutions, as demonstrated by recent advancements in content production, insight generation, and human-like engagement. There is an urgent need for additional scholarly research to gain a deeper understanding of how Gen-AI technologies are being adopted and spread across different industries in production systems. This study represents a preliminary attempt to investigate the current utilisation of Gen-AI by corporations, as well as the advantages and difficulties it entails, and the anticipated future of these technologies.},

Such systems promise to find out whether a given text was written by a human or created by an artificial intelligence (AI). The ability to identify the “synthetic” nature of a text is paramount in many workplaces as well as in the educational field, where we focused our research. More specifically, we considered the academic environment and the frequent request by faculty to students to write term papers on a wide variety of topics. Then, it is essential for teachers to be able to evaluate content quality as well as their authenticity. Until now, anti-plagiarism tools have been widely used to verify that homework assignments were not copied, but the recent advent of generative artificial intelligence-based tools changed the game, moving the focus to automatic generation. In both cases, we are facing a violation of the educational pact by a student, versus a teacher, if not outright an offence. Conversely, an unfounded accusation of fraud by a teacher toward a student would be equally serious. Therefore, to use automatic detection tools one must have a guarantee on the reliability of their output.},

    abstract = {This paper investigates the emerging field of emotional engineering which takes the form of a marriage between generative artificial intelligence (AI) and emotional intelligence that is set to redefine the future of human-machine collaboration. With the latest advances in AI having allowed for broad understanding and generation of human-like emotional responses, this paper illuminates the frameworks for creating systems that are capable of empathizing with and responding to the emotions of human users that can be widely applied across domains such as healthcare and customer service. The findings here indicate that user experiences can be drastically improved through applications such as those which allow for machines to accompany emotional intelligence, as they can enable more empathetic interactions. Emotion AI isn’t about having "feelings" in the human sense — it’s more about accurate and relevant emotional interaction. There’s no doubt "emotional engineering" will spawn gadgets that are truly empathetic and not just intelligent, but it also raises large questions about what happens now that we must account for emotions in our digital interactions.},

Because of their wide application scope, cyber-attacks have started to increase as causing a critical issue in terms of data security. Because of this, some analyses within IoT network environments should be done for prevention and detection purposes. At this point, it is also important to train users to establish an awareness about cyber threats for IoT and how to analyze network environments in case of unexpected situations. This paper introduces a Web platform, which provides some IoT security scenarios to learn about how to understand / detect cyber threats and test their knowledge. In detail, the platform uses a synthetic dataset of network data pointing malicious or benign network activities. The dataset was generated by Generative Adversarial Networks, which was fed by some original network traffic datasets. Thanks to the synthetic dataset, the platform is able to provide tests or scenarios for randomly chosen network traffic data so that users can learn and test their skills in terms of IoT security. The applications revealed that GAN was successful enough to generate synthetic traffic datasets and the users were positive about their experiences with the developed Web platform.},

This paper looks into how the modern AI art generators work and identifies the various issues with AI art on technical, moral and legal grounds. Furthermore it aims to understands how the increased accessibility to AI art generators affects humans.Modern AI art generators use artificial intelligence, machine learning algorithms and deep neural network algorithms to study a large amount of pre-existing artworks in portfolio and produce new art based on the prompts provided by the user. They use software such as CNN, GAN, NST.The biggest argument against AI art is that it needs the human creativity and imagination. But it has been argued that the human creativity is included in the text prompts provided by the artist. AI art generators have also been accused of stealing art works without permission of the artists which has been leading to some copyright issues. Furthermore AI art generators have been stealing artists’ commissions and work. AI art generators are not perfect yet and have several errors such as errors in the art generated such as anatomy errors(example: hands with six fingers instead of five etc). Artists have protested against the use of AI art generators. One such protest is the "No to AI generated images" movement wherein they flooded the portfolio in an AI art generator called "ArtStation" with images tagged as "trending in ArtStation in order to render all the generated images useless.},

This study addresses this gap by investigating how professionals perceive and utilize AI in DT workshops. Using affordance theory as a conceptual lens, we conducted observational studies and semi-structured interviews with DT experts to identify AI's action potentials, constraints, and mitigation strategies in this context. Our findings highlight four key affordances of AI in DT workshops: enhanced creativity, support for analytical tasks, facilitation of task initiation, and acceleration of processes. However, these benefits are tempered by challenges, including reduced team collaboration, diminished ownership of AI-generated outputs, and disruptions to workshop flow. The study reveals distinct human-AI interaction archetypes, underscoring the dynamic interplay between human expertise and AI capabilities. To mitigate constraints, we propose strategies such as pre-preparing AI-generated content, defining clear roles for AI and human inputs, and fostering collaborative reflection on AI outputs. By illuminating AI's potential and limitations within DT, this research contributes to the innovation management literature and offers actionable insights for practitioners seeking to integrate AI into hybrid innovation processes.},

Hence, mental disorders have become a serious public health challenge in nowadays society. Timely treatment of mental disorders plays a critical role for reducing the harm of mental illness to individuals and society. Music therapy is a type of non-pharmaceutical method in treating such mental disorders. However, conventional music therapy suffers from a number of issues resulting in a lack of popularity. Thanks to the rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI), especially the AI Generated Content (AIGC), it provides a chance to address these issues. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, there is no work investigating music therapy from AIGC and closed-loop perspective. In this paper, we summarise some universal music therapy methods and discuss their shortages. Then, we indicate some AIGC techniques, especially the music generation, for their application in music therapy. Moreover, we present a closed-loop music therapy system and introduce its implementation details. Finally, we discuss some challenges in AIGC-based music therapy with proposing further research direction, and we suggest the potential of this system to become a consumer-grade product for treating mental disorders.},

Here, AI/ML can address this by analyzing and linking the image-derived data to genomics data from cancer patients. In this work, we present a review of recent advances in image analysis using ML/AI for cancer diagnosis and treatment. In addition to that, we have discussed the recent methods of genomic data analysis for cancer classification and biomarker discovery.},

The key challenges in COVID-19 mitigation include effective immunization, treatment, and adaptable containment techniques. The promise of artificial intelligence (AI) in COVID-19 tracking, diagnostics and prognosis, medication discovery, vaccine development, and therapy of COVID-19 surveillance is the subject of this chapter. AI attempts to emulate the cognitive powers of the human brain, such as problem-solving and learning capacities, using massive data. Machine learning (ML), a subtype of AI, has particular potential in solving issues based on data-curated experiences. Advances in AI approaches have offered a previously unheard-of potential for constructing agile surveillance systems based on a flood of data gathered in a short period of time. Many publications during the course of the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of AI techniques in prioritizing, distribution, surveillance, medications, vaccines, and nonpharmaceutical therapies. This review will go over the clinical efficacy of AI-based models as well as the constraints and problems that AI systems face, such as model generalizability, explainability, and trust, which act as pillars for real-world deployment in healthcare.},

There are also still some hurdles on a technical and legal level as well as trust on the human side. Ultimately, the application of such techniques is particularly important in this area, but this is often not possible without the well-functioning and widespread use of Artificial Intelligence in manufacturing industry. However, it is a further step towards intelligent manufacturing and the acceptance of Artificial Intelligence in this area. The publication not only shows the latest developments, but also some use cases of Explainable Artificial Intelligence in manufacturing. Not only legal aspects but also ethical aspects are highlighted. In conclusion, it can be stated that Explainable Artificial Intelligence methods per se are well established, but their implementation and use in practice is lagging behind. A major point here in the future will be the explanation of generative artificial intelligence and user-centred explanations for non-domain experts. A standardised definition of explainability and standards for evaluating the individual methodologies must also be created.},

    abstract = {This paper investigates the ethical-legal issues underlying the implementation of Large Language Models, in the aftermath of the European Union Parliament's approval of the Artificial Intelligence Regulation. In very recent years, there has been a rapid evolution and multiform implementation of the so-called Artificial Intelligence. Notably, one significant development in AI is the creation of systems capable of performing tasks based on a set of established rules. Artificial Intelligence has recently undergone a significant revolution that has led to a radical paradigm shift, represented by the so-called Foundation Models, which have two main characteristics: emergence and homogenisation. On the other hand, Language Modelling (LM) is one of the main approaches to advance the linguistic intelligence of machines and thus a Foundation Model trained on textual data. The most recent development of this approach can be found in the so-called Large Language Models (LLM). These take the form of artificial neural networks pre-trained on huge datasets which, instead of being dedicated to a specific task, can perform a wide range of different functions at a level that is all the more accurate the greater the resources made available to them. The concept of language models is not new but has evolved with the progress of artificial intelligence over the decades. In general, LLMs are mainly trained in industrial settings where many important details of training (e.g. data collection and cleaning) are not disclosed. Thus, it is difficult to align LLMs with human values or preferences. Despite their capabilities, LLMs are also likely to produce toxic, fictitious or harmful content. Therefore, effective and efficient control approaches are required to eliminate the potential risk arising from the use of LLMs. For the purposes of the study conducted, it is intended to describe the development and outcomes with the aim to show not only the evolution of the responses offered by various LLM, but also and above all the possible ethical and legal implications that can be deduced from these outputs. Several models have been used for the implementation of the experiments: two GPT-2 models, Perplexity, ChatGPT (version 3.5), Llama. The language used for the implementation of the experiments was English, as it is structurally more neutral. In particular, with reference to a topic with a strong ethical and legal impact such as suicide, different answers were offered by the various models used. In conclusion, the essay offers reflections on the results of the experiment with reference to the EU Regulation on Artificial Intelligence. Artificial Intelligence represents for the jurist, not only European, a decisive challenge not only with regard to the categories of thought and formulation of operational languages, but above all with regard to the centrality of the human being. On the basis of these considerations, focusing on generative AI and in particular on Large Language Models, it is clear that many of the issues relating to copyright and the protection of personal data still remain unsolved, excluding those already regulated by the legislation on the point.},

Gaming studies hire and pay high costs to artists to create images for the game which is also time consuming. With the pervasive integration of artificial intelligence across various sectors, the application of AI in game development presents a promising solution to these challenges. This study focuses on the comparison and outcomes of two advanced generative AI tools, DALL-E and Midjourney, to reduce the time and cost associated with the creation of dynamic 2D game assets. The comparison process for both the AI tools involves creation of a Unity based game that integrates DALL-E and Midjourney to generate dynamic game assets which were used in the gameplay to get the user feedback inside the game. The findings reveal that both DALL-E and Midjourney significantly reduce the time and financial barriers traditionally associated with game asset creation, democratizing game development and allowing smaller studios to produce competitive content. DALL-E was found to be highly effective in rapidly transforming textual descriptions into high-quality visual assets, making it superior in terms of speed and cost-efficiency compared to Midjourney. Player feedback indicated a higher level of satisfaction and engagement with DALL-E-generated assets, particularly due to its superior performance in handling prompts and generating contextually relevant images.},

However, integrating digital culture with modernity while classifying AI image generation technology was a major concern. In this research, the hyper parameter tuned Deep Convolutional Neural Network with Stochastic Gradient (DCNN-SGD) is proposed to overcome these drawbacks, by classifying $A I$ images of product design. The open source AI images are collected and pre-processed to achieve noise free images by applying Gaussian filter. The pre-processed images are then fed to the CNN to extract features. The creative product design process is analysed which includes research and analysis, design expression and the final evaluation. The DCNN with convolutional, pooling and fully connected layers are used for the classification and identification of cultural symbols. For the effective identification of cultural heritage, the hyperparameters of the DCNN are finetuned with SGD. The experimental results showed that the proposed DCNN-SGD achieved better performance with classification accuracy of $\mathbf{9 8. 6 7 \%}$, precision of $\mathbf{9 5. 7 7 \%}$, and recall of $94.26 \%$ when compared to the existing methods improved Backpropagation Neural Network (BPNN) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN).},

    abstract = {Brainstorming, originally conceived by Alex Osborn in 1953, is widely recognized as an effective tool for promoting creativity and innovation within teams. However, as technologies advance and new tools emerge, such as duels of generative artificial intelligence, the brainstorming landscape is evolving. This study aims to investigate the use of Chat GPT, DALL-E and Miro in brainstorming sessions in presence, to evaluate the user experience of users depending on the tool used and their influence on human group creativity. It was followed by a design of repeated measurements research, where each group of participants carried out in succession the three sessions of brainstorming with the help of different tools. The methodology used is mixed qualitative and quantitative, through three online surveys. The key indicators considered include the total number of ideas generated, the uniqueness and feasibility of the same, as well as the subjective perception of participants on the effectiveness of the brainstorming process. In conclusion, this study aims to provide meaningful information on the use of artificial intelligence tools to facilitate or not collaborative creative processes, offering progression for future research in artificial intelligence-assisted innovation.},

    abstract = {Software developer's approaches to coding, testing, and deployment are changing due to the incorporation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into software development. AI-Augmented Software Development Tools simplify repetitive activities, boost productivity, and lessen the cognitive load on developers by utilizing machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), and other AI techniques. These tools support several development phases, including DevOps optimization, testing automation, problem discovery, and code generation. For example, AI-driven systems find flaws and inefficiencies in the code, while AI-powered code generation tools like GitHub Copilot help with code suggestion and completion. Additionally, AI automates debugging and test case creation, ensuring the scalability and dependability of software systems. Artificial intelligence (AI) improves quality assurance in complex contexts such as microservices and APIs by maximizing test coverage and identifying abnormalities. Additionally, AI-powered assistants help guide engineers through code inspections, security checks, and performance optimization. Notwithstanding these advantages, there are drawbacks to using AI tools, such as privacy issues and an excessive reliance on automation. With continued development, these tools have the potential to not only expedite development but also redirect the developer's attention towards more complex problem resolution, thereby transforming software engineering methodologies.

    abstract = {A table-native AI model that shortens time-to-value for predictive activities on tabular data is being built by SAP. It is called the SAP Foundation Model. The goal is to build a general-purpose prediction engine that can automatically generate predictions from tabular data with minimal or no more training data. Although LLMs excel at text generation, they struggle with business-related data that is tabular and has challenges with categorisation, regression, and prediction. In fact, the SAP Foundation Model can compete with and even surpass these conventional methods while providing the flexibility of foundation models; in contrast, state-of-the-art LLMs perform 20-50% worse than incumbent restricted AI approaches in comparable cases. SAP has a long track record of successfully meeting business needs, and the company's stated goal is to develop AI that is useful, trustworthy, and socially conscious so that it can assist clients in solving their business challenges. Another innovative strategy for AI development, federated learning is quickly becoming the standard for delivering AI apps to the periphery of industrial networks. Research into the development of ethical guidelines and frameworks for the deployment of AI in MIS should prioritize the safety and security of data. In order to reap the benefits of AI integration for businesses, one must first establish a cohesive digital business plan. Another is getting people to interact with AI despite obstacles.},

Artificial Intelligence has been with us since the first half of the twentieth century. Due to hardware limitations at that time, computers could not execute and store commands. Because of the fast pace of technology, both storing and executing flourished, and so came the birth of artificial intelligence. This study aims to explore how artificial intelligence affects customer relations by discussing different kinds of chatbots. It briefly outlines how integrating chatbots or conversational AI significantly affects how customers behave in the retail business. Incorporating human characteristics into conversational agents drives the design of generative AI chatbots. Studies indicate that more work has to be done to improve chatbot performance. Improvements include reducing the chatbot's usage of cliches and enabling users to approach conversations sincerely. Studies indicate that more work has to be done to improve chatbot performance. Circling back to the anthropomorphism theory, trust in chatbots and chatbot overload further significantly impact service evaluation and customer purchase.},

Drawing on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Social Support Theory (SST), the research examines perceived usefulness, ease of use, and support measures, including educational and emotional support. The study was conducted at King Saud University, where it adopted a quantitative approach, collecting data from 350 participants through a structured survey. A final sample of 308 valid responses was analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). The findings revealed significant relationships between key constructs: perceived educational support positively influenced perceived usefulness ( $\beta = 0.160$ , p = 0.000) and attitudes toward AI ( $\beta = 0.140$ , p = 0.010). Perceived usefulness ( $\beta = 0.670$ , p = 0.000) and ease of use ( $\beta = 0.330$ , p = 0.000) were strong predictors of positive attitudes, which, in turn, significantly shaped intentions to use AI ( $\beta = 0.760$ , p = 0.000). Emotional support and cognitive support also had notable but mixed effects on perceived usefulness. However, social interaction support and perceived enjoyment did not demonstrate significant influence. These findings highlight the importance of designing AI systems that emphasise usability and provide robust educational and emotional support to enhance acceptance. The study contributes to theory by extending TAM with constructs from SST, offering new insights into AI adoption in academic contexts. Practically, the results guide policymakers and developers in fostering AI acceptance by addressing educational and emotional needs, ensuring effective implementation in higher education.},

However, integration into the industry processes is happening at a slow pace. This paper represents a survey conducted with 163 industrial engineers on the use of AI in product development. The questionnaire specifically focuses on the early phase of product development and investigates the current state, challenges and potentials. The results show a high level of interest in the use of AI, but integration into everyday working processes has been low so far. Among the few who incorporate AI into their concept development processes, an indication to shorter concept development times was observed.

Nevertheless, a significant gap continues to exist in the effective surveillance of human actions, activities, and the recognition of human movements or poses. Machines and computers are fundamentally incapable of comprehending human activities without user intervention. Consequently, we now depend on technology to record and archive human actions through live broadcast data, videos, or images. The field of pose estimation, which is a critical area of research with applications in fields such as Augmented Reality, Animation, Gaming, Healthcare, and Sports, is expanding due to the rapid advancement of computer vision technology. This project implements innovative methods to train models and deter- mine poses, utilizing random inputs from internet images, videos, and live streaming. In particular, models that have been trained with artificial intelligence have been created for daily physical activities that necessitate intricate pose estimation. The initial step in the project is to utilize MediaPipe to estimate the poses of the human body. Subsequently, the angles between the body joints are calculated to create the desired models. Additionally, a web-based user interface (WEB-UI) was developed to enable access from any location. The methodology involves the extraction of data from critical body locations, the framing of models, and the utilization of the MediaPipe model due to its superior performance and features in comparison to other models. The objective of this method is to develop a web application for end-users, train AI models for daily physical activities, and establish an efficient system for single human pose estimation. This approach provides a cost-effective alternative to physical trainers and enables the monitoring of health and sports activities to be enhanced.},

This study examines the effectiveness of the ChatGPT prompt framework in improving text analysis skills among students, specifically targeting readability, accuracy, completeness, logicality, and critical thinking. Conducted among high school students in Canada, the research assesses how GAI prompt frameworks significantly affect the quality of students’ analytical responses. Results showed significant improvements in all five aspects of readability, accuracy, completeness, logicality, and critical thinking, especially for students with no prior knowledge of the topic. However, enhancements in completeness and critical thinking were less pronounced, suggesting that while the ChatGPT framework substantially supports basic analytical skills, its effectiveness varies depending on the complexity of cognitive tasks and the extent of students’ existing knowledge. The study underscores the significant role that advanced GAI tools can play in modern educational environments, promoting deeper engagement with learning materials and enhancing students’ analytical abilities. It highlights the necessity of integrating these technologies to cater to diverse learning needs and cognitive challenges.},

However, their inherently contradictory characteristics present significant challenges to direct knowledge sharing. Furthermore, conventional methods that independently optimize fine-tuning and inference lack the foresight to achieve long-term network benefits. To address these challenges, we propose the GAI-oriented synthetic network (GaisNet), a collaborative cloud-edge-end intelligence framework that integrates fine-tuning and inference. GaisNet, specifically, can mitigate contradictions by leveraging data-free knowledge relays, where bidirectional knowledge flow facilitates a virtuous cycle of model fine-tuning and task inference with a long-term perspective, fostering mutualism between GAI and EI in the IIoV. A case study illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed mechanisms. Finally, we discuss the future challenges and directions in the interplay between GAI and EI.},

It was in 1956 that John McCarthy first used the term &#x201c;artificial intelligence,&#x201d; and since then, it has become an indispensable component of our everyday life. AI is now the most widely used source of computation, and its applications range from automated voice systems to personalized movie suggestions. On the other hand, these systems depend on intricate methods such as speech recognition, natural language processing, and predictive analytics. As the way we interact with technology continues to be revolutionized by AI, it is essential to consider the potential privacy and security risks that come with it. Specifically, gathering and utilizing sensitive patient information to train AI models has given rise to significant issues. Patients, healthcare providers, and software vendors can suffer serious repercussions due to any utilization or disclosure of patient information. As a result of these worries, this chapter investigates the development and incorporation of AI into our health and information systems, with a particular emphasis on protecting personal information and safety.</p>},

    abstract = {Embodied Question Answering (EQA) is a task in artificial intelligence where an intelligent agent is required to answer questions about its environment. For example, to answer a question such as "Is the TV on or off?", the agent must navigate to the room with the TV and answer with either "On." or "Off." after recognizing the status. Unlike traditional question-answering systems that rely solely on text or static images, EQA involves agents that can move through a physical or simulated space, interact with the environment, and gather information to respond accurately. The agent must interpret both visual and linguistic inputs, navigate the environment, and complete tasks or locate objects based on the user’s questions. However, in the real world, the agent always faces unseen environments (i.e. different people’s houses), which makes the pre-trained model fail. Meanwhile, re-training in an unseen environment can cause high costs. Therefore, it is significant for the agent to learn continually by itself to cope with the challenges of unseen environments. In this work, we proposed a continual learning method based on generative adversarial imitation learning and self-supervision to support the agent when facing unseen environments. Besides, we designed a policy generator and policy quality discriminator to generate action policy sequences and evaluate the quality of the policy, respectively. Extensive experiments on the MP3D-EQA dataset demonstrate that our method reaches state-of-the-art performance.},

It outlines the initiatives to introduce GenAI into a graduate-level software engineering course in Software Verification and Validation (SV&V). The paper presents the educational goals, methodologies and findings of these endeavors in this course. The primary education goal of this course is that students have a solid understanding of principles and practices of software quality assurance and seek to introduce students to diverse techniques employed for SV&V. The study presented in this paper centers on the practical application of GenAI within the domain of testing strategies. The paper introduces the findings of an exercise where GenAI was used to apply testing strategies for unit testing. The exercise consisted of the use of GenAI in the development of unit tests for an algorithm. Rigorous assessments were conducted to gauge the effectiveness of the unit tests developed for validating the accurate implementation of the algorithm. This exploration shed light on the tangible impact of GenAI on the precision and efficiency of unit testing procedures. The findings underscore the significance of encouraging students to actively explore emerging trends and methodologies in the realm of software verification and validation. By incorporating GenAI into the educational framework, students not only gain insights into the capabilities and limitations of this technology but also foster a mindset of continuous learning in software quality assurance. The paper demonstrates that it is not sufficient to use the test cases developed by GenAI for software validation since test cases recommended by GenAI do not cover corner cases which causes gaps in coverage in unit testing. The majority of the students were able to understand the limitation of GenAI in SV&V but appreciated its support in suggesting test cases for the most common cases. This exercise allowed students to enhance their creative problem-solving through human-guided AI partnership which is pivotal in cultivating a new generation of professionals capable of contributing to the ongoing evolution of software quality.},

Specifically, we synthesized the literature and highlighted the possible cybersecurity risks and ethical concerns associated with advancements in AI. Background: Recent advancements in AI have implicated various risks and ethical concerns regarding cybersecurity. Prior literature studies have highlighted a plethora of these issues. We have conducted a systematic review to analyze the issues presented in the prior literature. Analyzing the issues presented has allowed us to answer one research question. Research Question: Our study answered one research question: Given the continuous advancements in artificial intelligence, what are cybersecurity's potential risks and ethical concerns? Methodology: We utilized the IEEE Xplore database to answer the research question. After setting the search criteria to journal articles posted between 2019 and 2024, we found 67 articles relevant to our keywords. After screening, we finalized 16 articles to address our research question. The articles selected were analyzed using qualitative thematic analysis. Articles were then categorized into three different themes: (1) social engineering, (2) misinformation and fake news, and (3) hacking. Findings: Our findings indicate that researchers have informed us about the malicious use of AI in cybersecurity by classifying attacks into three themes. These themes indicate the manner of attack. Furthermore, we find that the major risks and ethical concerns regarding the application of AI in cybersecurity relate to the preservation of privacy. As the field of artificial intelligence continues to grow, we see that it is imperative to continue monitoring the safety of this technology. For researchers to serve the public, future work should aim to translate technical terminology into more digestible phrases for those not knowledgeable in the field.},

CodeBlizz utilizes proficient transformer-based models, such as CodeBERT for comprehending syntax and producing useful snippets and GPT-3 to generate context-aware code referrals. Also, the plugin employs T5 models to provide real-time problem detection and debugging support by turning malfunctioning code into error messages and possible fixes. Added to that, adaptive learning from user feedback is feasible with reinforcement learning models such as Deep Q-Networks (DQN), which boosts the accuracy of the model over time. Together, these machine learning elements allow CodeBlizz to provide developers with solid and dynamic support from within the IDE, which helps to boost accuracy and speed up code completion. Without pushing users to leave the IDE, the plugin renders functionalities encompassing dynamically generated code snippets, syntax correction, error pattern identification, and real-time tutorials for learning at ease. On the survey, users reported a thirty percent reduction in time spent on error correction and tutorial seeks from online websites, which further validates the benefit of incorporating AI that generates code for immediate guidance within the coding routine. Early testing demonstrates a significant boost in coding accuracy.},

While there is ongoing debate about the use of AI for writing manuscripts, completing assignments, and other working tasks, this research takes a step back to address a fundamental question: How accurate and efficient is AI in helping to conduct research? This research focuses on the initial step of research - literature search and screening. As the volume of academic literature grows exponentially, efficient and effective methods for synthesizing existing knowledge become crucial for scientific discovery. This research aims to explore the potential of AI-driven solutions in the literature screening process and compare them with traditional labor- and time-intensive approaches. Adopting a comparative analysis approach, this research examines both traditional manual screening techniques and AI-powered approaches and evaluates AI’ s performances. Data were collected from a comprehensive review of existing literature on the multidisciplinary topic of the digital divide. The analysis focuses on the accuracy, efficiency, and usefulness of AI in processing large volumes of literature. Results suggested that AI-driven approaches can reduce substantial manual work and time investment while maintaining certain levels of accuracy in identifying relevant studies. However, the challenge of algorithmic bias remains, and this calls for human intervention. Instead of AI replacing humans, our findings suggest a hybrid approach - combining AI capabilities with human expertise. Such an approach offers the most promising solutions for future literature review and screening processes, evidencing the synergy between AI and humans.},

At the same time, there is a lack of critical technical research and support within the industry to accurately measure the model's ability to provide reliable service in real power business scenarios. Through the effective evaluation of the adversarial robustness of the power vision model under three different strategies: white box, grey box and black box, the performance of the power vision model under adversarial attack is verified, and the security and reliability of the power vision model in key power scenario applications are guaranteed, the security risks of the model are reduced, and the reliability of model users on model output decisions is improved. In turn, it can enhance the confidence of users, accumulate more high-quality data in the process of frequent use and sustainable training, and improve the ability of artificial intelligence models, which complement each other, and finally make artificial intelligence technology fully land in the power grid, so that the power grid can enter the intelligent era as soon as possible.},

This paper will, at first, make an attempt to give some sort of comprehensive overview of the current state of AI technologies. Among the AI tools and algorithms, it is the special attention of somehow making their applications within the realm of literary creation, analysis, and interpretation. The core of these studies plunges into the details of what AI has to do with generating literary content, be it through algorithms writing poems, short stories, and even novels in the style of famous authors or totally from scratch. This study expands the scope of consideration to the collaborative processes between human authors and AI, focusing on synergetic potential for creative exploration and emergence of hybrid authorial identities. In addition, implications of the use of AI in literary analysis were described due to the fact that it is being applied to reveal new critical insights into classic texts using machine-learning models, predicting the future direction of literature, and even critiquing—again using a similar style generator—works of literature with a degree of insight thought previously exclusive to human scholars. Another important focus area will be the pedagogical implications for integrating AI into English literature education.},

However, deploying these transformer-based models in resource-constrained environments poses a significant challenge due to their high computational and memory demands. To address this, we introduce in this article generative AI (GenAI) on the Edge, a comprehensive benchmarking dataset designed to evaluate the performance of LLMs deployed on edge devices. Leveraging a distributed testbed of Raspberry Pi 5 devices orchestrated with lightweight Kubernetes (K3s), the dataset captures a broad range of performance metrics essential for assessing the feasibility of local inference in constrained environments. These metrics include detailed measurements of throughput, inference latency, memory utilization, and computational efficiency, along with granular timing data for key stages of the inference pipeline—sample, prefill, and decode phases. We systematically evaluate LLMs of varying sizes under real-world deployment scenarios, with a particular emphasis on CPU-based edge platforms. By conducting multiple runs of conversation-based evaluations, GenAI on the Edge provides actionable insights into the tradeoffs between performance and resource efficiency, enabling better decision-making for LLM deployment in edge environments.

The everexpanding business is driving a significant rise in the application of computer science to address various issues inside it. It becomes difficult to discover a personalized wardrobe that reflects their preferences, taste and needs. Traditional Fashion Recommendation Systems (FRSs) limits their ability to scale and adapt the ever growing styles as they heavily rely on manual design. Fashion can also be so inclusive, expressive and sustainable. Appropriate recommendations given by FRS helps to enhance user satisfaction and makes it more enjoyable and accessible. Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools have revolutionized FRS enabling them to consume beyond conventional methods by taking in contextual data, user preferences and visual content for recommendations with a more individualized suggestion. Recently, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have emerged as a potent technique to enhance these systems by generating diverse fashion designs with high fidelity. In this paper, a systematic review of parameters used to evaluate FRS using Generative Algorithms is discussed. Various parameters to evaluate system performance and the recommendation quality are analyzed. Detailed analysis of the input parameters, to be considered to design the efficient AI based FRS (AI-FRS) is also presented. Along with this, research gaps are explored by surveying numerous review papers. This review will help in deciding the evaluation parameters to develop and examine more efficient AI based FRS.},

The integration of AI technologies into interior architecture is reshaping the way spaces are conceived, designed, and utilized, offering creativity and efficiency. Current research revealed that there is still a lack of review papers exploring the patterns and trends in the use of AI in interior architecture. Therefore, this thematic review (TR) aims to discuss the current use of AI applied in interior architecture by synthesizing the literature from 2020 to 2024 using ATLAS.ti 23. A keyword search, followed by a filter using inclusion criteria from SCOPUS and Emerald databases, identified 30 peer-reviewed journal articles which then were clustered into several themes _1) Design aesthetics and methodology, 2) Innovative material design, 3) Eco-Quality design, and 4) Intelligent system design. The results of this study will offer an overview of the need for a new method of designing interior space, and practical strategies for integrating AI in the interior. This review also serves as a valuable resource for interior architects and designers, seeking into the potential of AI in creating intelligent, and user-centered spaces.},

    abstract = {Text-to-Image Synthesis has gained significant attention due to its ability to generate realistic visuals from textual descriptions. Existing methods, such as Attention-based GAN s and Transformer models, often face challenges in maintaining semantic alignment between text and images, handling complex textual inputs, and ensuring high-quality outputs. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DC-GAN) framework leveraging GloVe embeddings for semantic representation. The Oxford 102 Flower dataset, comprising image-text pairs, is used to train and evaluate the model. The DC-GAN architecture includes a generator to synthesize images and a discriminator to validate authenticity, enabling iterative improvement. Evaluation metrics show an average Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) score of 0.286 and a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 1.455, demonstrating semantic coherence and low pixel-level deviations. Challenges such as refining fine-grained image details and enhancing robustness across diverse datasets persist. This study highlights the potential of DC-GAN for multimodal AI applications, including targeted advertising, virtual reality, and creative design. By advancing text-to-image synthesis, the research provides a robust framework for future exploration in generating semantically consistent and high-quality visuals from text.},

They are widely used in programming, audio, and video processing fields, significantly enhancing productivity in these areas. However, various problems have also arisen during their application. At its core, generative AI still relies on symbolic formal logic and lacks the ability to simulate human cognitive patterns of understanding the world through prior logic or even dialectical logic. As such, it is impossible for these systems to achieve strong artificial intelligence as we know it. Currently, computer systems are founded on discrete mathematics and symbolic logic. This paper proposes an idea that combines prior logic theory with object-oriented programming techniques, using categorical judgment methods as a foundation to mimic human cognition patterns and discusses a possibility of approaching the realization of strong artificial intelligence.},

    abstract = {Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) models face significant challenges in abstract reasoning tasks, which require deep understanding and generalization across a wide range of domains. This study introduces a novel hybrid multicomponent architecture designed to enhance AGI performance on abstract reasoning tasks. The proposed model integrates advanced techniques including Transformer-based self-attention mechanisms, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and Reinforcement Learning (RL). Each component addresses distinct aspects of the task: Transformers capture sequence dependencies, GNNs model complex relationships between entities, GANs generate realistic data for training, and RL optimizes reasoning strategies. The synergy of these components allows the model to achieve strong generalization and abstract learning capabilities, significantly improving performance compared to single-component models. The experimental results on the ARC-AGI benchmark demonstrate the superiority of this hybrid approach, with marked improvements in key performance metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, mean squared error (MSE), and AUC-ROC. These results confirm that the proposed model is a promising solution to overcoming the limitations of current AGI systems in tackling novel and complex reasoning tasks. Future work will focus on further optimization of the model components, expanding its scope to more complex tasks, and evaluating its performance in practical applications such as natural language understanding and robotics.},

Human-machine collaborative teaching (HMCT) is a new paradigm that leverages the strengths of both human educators and AI tools to enhance learning outcomes. This study investigates the effectiveness of three human-machine collaborative teaching strategies—directive, guided, and collaborative-implemented in a university—level software engineering course. The experiment involved 99 third-year students and aimed to evaluate the impact of these teaching strategies on creativity and academic performance. The results show that the collaborative teaching method, enhanced by generative AI tools, led to the highest performance in final exams and overall academic achievement, as well as increased participation in extracurricular innovation activities in homework. While directive teaching produced consistent results, it did not foster the same level of engagement or creativity. Guided teaching demonstrated moderate success, but the greatest benefits were observed in the collaborative approach, where students took an active role in their learning. This study suggests that integrating AI into collaborative learning environments can enhance both academic outcomes and student creativity, and recommends expanding the use of AI-supported strategies in higher education. Future research should explore the scalability of these findings across disciplines and investigate long-term impacts on student development and career readiness.},

    abstract = {Recent advances in diffusion models have opened new avenues for research into embodied AI agents and robotics. Despite significant achievements in complex robotic locomotion and skills, mobile manipulation–a capability that requires the coordination of navigation and manipulation–remains a challenge for generative AI techniques. This is primarily due to the high-dimensional action space, extended motion trajectories, and interactions with the surrounding environment. In this paper, we introduce M2 Diffuser, a diffusion-based, scene-conditioned generative model that directly generates coordinated and efficient whole-body motion trajectories for mobile manipulation based on robot-centric 3D scans. M2 Diffuser first learns trajectory-level distributions from mobile manipulation trajectories provided by an expert planner. Crucially, it incorporates an optimization module that can flexibly accommodate physical constraints and task objectives, modeled as cost and energy functions, during the inference process. This enables the reduction of physical violations and execution errors at each denoising step in a fully differentiable manner. Through benchmarking on three types of mobile manipulation tasks across over 20 scenes, we demonstrate that M2 Diffuser outperforms state-of-the-art neural planners and successfully transfers the generated trajectories to a real-world robot. Our evaluations underscore the potential of generative AI to enhance the generalization of traditional planning and learning-based robotic methods, while also highlighting the critical role of enforcing physical constraints for safe and robust execution.

    abstract = {Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) hold immense potential to revolutionize transportation, yet their deployment raises significant concerns regarding safety, security, and ethical considerations. Furthermore, the increased use of automation, edge computing, and Artificial Intelligence (AI), fueled by generative AI technology, has increasingly elevated the risks of AI. Most of the existing research only covers ethical components and lacks the breadth of Responsible AI (RAI), while some have presented components such as justice and solidarity but do not provide an approach or mechanism to implement those in an AI-based system. This paper addresses these gaps by proposing a comprehensive RAI framework for AVs with four key contributions. First, it provides an in-depth analysis of AI risks in AVs, encompassing safety, security, ethical, and legal domains, offering a structured classification to guide developers and regulators. Second, it introduces a holistic RAI framework that spans the AI lifecycle, identifying and mitigating risks at each AV system development and deployment stage. Third, the paper focuses on bias and fairness within AV systems, outlining precise techniques for bias detection and mitigation across data collection, algorithm design, and real-time decision-making. Lastly, the research presents bias removal simulations using publicly available AV datasets, evaluating mitigation strategies such as synthetic data generation and algorithmic fairness analysis. The proposed framework and simulations provide a practical foundation for integrating RAI principles into AV development, ensuring safer, fairer, and more accountable AI-driven mobility solutions.},

    abstract = {The utilization of Generative AI (GEN AI) has experienced a substantial increase because of investments and a variety of applications in various sectors. In 2023, the aggregate investment in generative AI exceeded $10 billion. Additionally, AI is a highly prevalent technology in China, with 83% of its companies significantly relying on it. Subsequently, India accounts for 73% of Gen AI usage, while Malaysia's data suggests that this technology is employed in the marketing sector. This investment has resulted in an increased utilization of AI tools in the areas of retail, supply chain management, and customer service. This technology enhances productivity, efficiency, and creativity in a variety of sectors. Nevertheless, it raises a few challenges that necessitate robust governance and regulation. GEN AI prioritizes transparency and accountability; AI systems could perpetuate prejudices and erode trust in the absence of regulations. In the context of contemporary concerns, this paper assesses the regulatory endeavors and issues of Malaysia and India with respect to Generative AI. This paper employs doctrinal research on primary and secondary sources. Malaysia and India have recently disclosed a variety of data breaches and unethical Gen AI practices. Therefore, even though Generative AI is streamlining marketing and assisting in numerous business sectors, the government must re-evaluate its governance, including legal and regulatory mechanisms, to determine whether it complies with international standards and contemplate reforms. The government must also look into balancing the need for innovation and evaluate data protection and privacy concerns.},

    abstract = {This paper explores the application of Generative AI, specifically ChatGPT, in urban energy management, assessing human users’ trust in AI systems that, while often accurate, can still make mistakes. It examines how different stakeholder groups—AI experts, energy domain experts, and non-experts—develop trust, distrust, or overtrust in AI-generated outputs and highlights the risks associated with these trust states. While overtrust can lead to blind reliance on incorrect AI outputs, distrust can result in the unnecessary rejection of accurate AI recommendations, ultimately reducing the effectiveness of AI-assisted decision-making. Using the VIRTSI (Variability and Impact of Reciprocal Trust States towards Intelligent Systems) methodology, this research monitors human-AI trust evolution through Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) and quantifies trust behaviors using user-adapted Confusion Matrices, addressing a critical gap in AI trust dynamics that traditional acceptance models overlook. The findings validate VIRTSI’s ability to track trust transitions. The study reveals that AI experts exhibit skepticism due to their awareness of AI’s limitations, energy experts tend to overtrust AI, likely influenced by its confident and seemingly reliable responses, and non-experts display inconsistent trust, highlighting decision-making challenges. These findings confirm VIRTSI’s premise that trust in AI is dynamic, varies by user expertise, and must be continuously monitored and assessed. Ultimately, this study strengthens VIRTSI as a necessary framework for assessing and optimizing trust in AI-driven sustainability solutions, ensuring that AI systems are not only trusted but also used effectively and responsibly in energy applications. Unlike other models of technology acceptance that focus solely on adoption, VIRTSI provides a continuous and quantifiable approach to trust calibration, identifying harmful trust patterns and guiding improvements in AI-human interaction over time.},

Therefore, knowing how these models work is vital to understanding the mechanisms of how AI tools are built. AI systems are built on algorithms that enable computers to learn from data and improve their performance over time. For machine learning to be effective, it needs the proper training data set. The model is built from machines that use algorithms to learn from the data provided. In supervised learning, algorithms learn from labeled data to make predictions or classifications. Unsupervised learning uses algorithms that find patterns or structures in unlabeled data. Discriminative AI seeks to classify and differentiate data, essentially learning the differences between different categories of data. Training generative AI models often involve unsupervised learning, enabling the model to digest and understand large amounts of text, images, or videos.</p>},

Art is the most threatened field due to AI, potentially affecting the market value of an artist's creation. These generated images also affect artists who rely on their work for income as the accessibility of these models diminishes the demand for hiring real artists. As these generative models continue to evolve, it is becoming more difficult to differentiate between authentic art and generated ones. This paper addresses the need for a tool that can accurately distinguish between human-made and AI-generated artworks using a convolutional neural network (CNN) known as EfficientNetV2, ResNet50, and VGGNet. Our methodology involves using a dataset comprising images created by both human artists and AI algorithms.

    abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) has revolutionized higher education with features like instant feedback, resource and material creation, adaptive learning, interactivity, and more. However, GAI also brings with it a number of serious challenges that raise ethical and moral concerns regarding academic integrity. To carry out this transition process, it will be necessary to develop clear guidelines that adhere to integrity standards and ethical codes of higher education institutions. In addition to offering responses to a number of research questions, the purpose of this study is to further the current discourse surrounding the moral guidelines for GAI in higher education. Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) technique and Bibliometric Analysis using VOSviewer, 37 related research studies were reviewed and evaluated. The results demonstrate that the number of articles published has been increasing over time, with the largest number of scientific publications occurring in 2024. This can be explained by the fact that, despite the fact that GAI offers benefits and drawbacks for the educational sector, particularly for higher education, it also makes clear how important it is for professionals and organizations to use GAI tools in order to handle ethical issues by continuously developing policies. By creating norms and policies, future ethical problems with GAI in education may be more accurately predicted. The engagement and dedication of academic experts and other relevant stakeholders are essential to achieving this goal of increasing public awareness and effectively utilizing GAI technology.},

Moreover, AI-driven simulations offer insights into artistic intent and historical contexts, enabling restorers to make informed decisions. This interdisciplinary approach merges art history, chemistry, and computer science, fostering a new era of cultural heritage preservation.

Comprehensive experiments are conducted on the SG-126 power grid simulator under three representative scenarios to evaluate the performance and generalization capability of GARL. The results show that GARL can learn the distribution characteristics of stateaction-reward sequence from historical experience, establish the mapping relationship between current state and future cumulative reward, and improve the accuracy of future power grid operation trend prediction, which is always better than the independent DDPG algorithm.

    abstract = {Utilizing Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods in medical imaging has completely changed how early disease screening is done, leading to big gains in accuracy, speed, and patient results. This essay looks at how AI can improve medical images. It focuses on deep learning algorithms, computer vision, and machine learning models that can make complicated diagnosis tasks easier to do automatically. These technologies make it possible to find and study small trends in medical pictures that a person might miss. This helps doctors make faster and more accurate diagnoses, especially in cancer, heart, and neurology. AI can find problems in X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and its performance is on par with or even better than that of expert doctors. The paper also looks at how AI can be used to predict diseases by looking at old image data along with clinical factors. Researchers are looking at techniques like reinforcement learning and generative adversarial networks (GANs) to see if they can improve picture quality and help make fake data for rare diseases. This will help make diagnosis tools that are more accurate. The study also shows how AI is becoming more and more important for solving problems like inconsistent data, picture noise, and wrong interpretations. As healthcare continues to go digital, adding AI to medical imaging systems could help with personalized treatment plans, lower the number of mistakes made during diagnosis, and speed up work processes.},

    abstract = {Based on the problems of insufficient design innovation and low design efficiency in personalized visual communication design, this study uses the style transfer algorithm to apply a specific artistic style to the design and automatically generates visual elements with personalized characteristics. At the same time, Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) are used to create new patterns and color combinations and enhance the diversity of design, while ChatGPT is used to parse user needs and transform text descriptions into design concepts. In the process of implementing these methods, this paper collects and analyzes user data to build user portraits to understand their preferences and needs. This paper also uses a style transfer algorithm to combine user-favorite elements with design templates to generate preliminary design sketches. Then GAN intervenes to generate new design elements and uses these elements to enrich and refine the design content. During the design process, the artificial intelligence model is continuously optimized based on user feedback to ensure that the final output design not only meets the user's personalized needs but is also highly innovative and attractive. Ultimately, these individually adjusted designs are output in an appropriate format for application in actual products or services. Based on comparative experiments, this paper found that personalized design is superior to traditional design methods in multiple key indicators: the average innovation score of personalized design is as high as 9.06, higher than the 6.89 of traditional design; the time required for personalized design is mainly concentrated between 20 and 30 minutes, while the time required for traditional design ranges from 30 to nearly 50 minutes and fluctuates greatly; the adoption rate of personalized design reaches a minimum of 90.2% and a maximum of 99.9%, while the adoption rate of traditional design is lower, with a minimum of only 75.2% and a maximum of only 88.7%. Through comparative analysis, this paper confirms the advantages of personalized design over traditional design in multiple dimensions, and demonstrates the application potential and value of artificial intelligence technology in the field of design.},

The generative AI uses a diffusion model and incorporates a transformer model to output a series of innovative and practical antenna structures according to the input antenna requirements. To select the optimal structure from a large set of candidates, we further incorporate the Characteristic Mode Analysis (CMA) method into the Bilinear Convolutional Neural Networks (BCNN) model for evaluation and selection. The antenna inverse design scheme cleverly combines AI with the CMA method, which greatly simplifies the tedious process of traditional antenna design. By simply inputting the antenna requirements, the optimal antenna structure, distinct from existing datasets, can be rapidly obtained. Since the output is an antenna structure, it is not limited to a specific frequency band, thus offering design flexibility for cross-band adjustments. This letter presents case studies on single-band, dual-band, and wideband circularly polarized microstrip antennas to validate the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

A central challenge in this field lies in bridging textual analysis with the spatial and sensory dimensions of settings described or implied in texts. Traditional methodologies often require scholars to mentally reconstruct these environments, leading to incomplete or inconsistent interpretations. Readers may be biased by their personal context or experiences, or may lack detailed knowledge of the relevant historical facts. This paper argues for the integration of virtual reality and generative artificial intelligence as supporting instruments to enhance literary research. The former enables immersive, spatially accurate reconstructions of historical environments, while the latter provides tools such as text-to-image and text-to-3D generation which let us dynamically render visual elements quoted in literary texts. Together, these technologies have the potential to significantly enhance traditional literature analysis methodologies, enabling novel approaches for contextualizing and analyzing literature in its spatial and cultural milieu.},

However, the detection noise is an inevitable byproduct of the real-time imaging process. Additionally, fluorescent probes currently approved for clinical use remain limited within the wavelength of NIR-IIa (1000–1300 nm). NIR-IIb (1500–1700 nm) imaging has the potential to deliver higher resolution than NIR-IIa, but relies on toxic fluorescent probes not approved for human use. To support clinical high-precision imaging, we propose a NIR-II fluorescence enhanced imaging method based on perception-enhanced spectrum shift generative adversarial network with explainable AI systems (xAI-PSSGAN). The proposed method tackles the problem of limited unpaired data training, and generates NIR-IIb resembling images with enhanced resolution and reduced noise. Experimental results demonstrate that proposed method effectively improves the imaging quality and surpasses competing alternatives, which is of great significance to promote the high-quality NIR-II imaging in clinical practice.},

    abstract = {The integration of artificial intelligence into educational tools is transforming learning environments. In computer science, students frequently encounter challenges with complex concepts and practical applications. While LLMs offer valuable support, their responses can sometimes lack precision or rely on outdated information. Addressing these limitations is essential to enhance the effectiveness of AI-based tools in educational support. The main objective of this paper is to propose a tool-based RAG as automated assistant in an OOP Course. The tool was tested using common student queries and its responses were compared with those generated by ChatGPT. Initial observations suggest that RAG consistently generated contextually relevant responses due to its ability to access pertinent information from a structured knowledge base, resulting in more precise and applicable answers for students. The introduction of a RAG-based tool in classrooms has the potential to enhance student learning by providing instant, tailored responses to specific queries.},

However, AI largely leverages discriminative models relying on labelled and quality data, where data accessibility remains serious concern. Generative AI (GenAI) has gained traction due to its immense potential in resolving the issue of data scarcity, complexity, and incompleteness. GenAI models excel in understanding underlying data distributions, enabling them to generate synthetic data that mirrors real-world patterns. GenAI supports adaptive learning and scenario modeling, making it indispensable for addressing the unpredictability and complexity inherent in 6G networks. Since the complexity of wireless communication systems is increasing and the demand for such systems is growing, GenAI presents new ideas for enhancing network performance, increasing system efficiency, and developing intelligent decision-making capabilities. This survey paper investigates the promising role of GenAI in the evolution of 6G networks. An in-depth discussion of notable GenAI models is presented, outlining their application in enhancing key network components. Specifically, the application of GenAI in advanced technologies including reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), digital twins (DTs), and integrated sensing and communications (ISACs) is thoroughly investigated with respect to optimize the adaptability, flexibility, and robustness of the wireless networks. Moreover, use cases of GenAI-enabled wireless networks are presented to highlight the realization of GenAI in 6G. The paper also presents the lessons learned, existing challenges, and future research directions. This paper systematically explores GenAI and its pivotal role in the development of 6G, providing a foundation for researchers to further investigate and advance GenAI-enabled 6G.},

By using neural networks, the simulation process is simplified. Thousands of 2D and 3D simulations were conducted, and the neural network design, comprising an initial Neural Network (NN), and a following pix2pix network, effectively predicts and refines the magnetic field. This method reduces computational time from seconds to milliseconds and achieves deviations of less than 5 %.},

    abstract = {Cybersecurity is facing increasingly sophisticated threats, such as ransomware, complex DDoS attacks, and zero-day attacks. These evolving threats reveal the limitations of traditional detection, prevention, and response methods. In this context, the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) emerges as a promising solution. Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms enable enhanced detection of malicious behaviors, real-time anomaly identification, and the anticipation of cyberattacks before they cause significant damage. However, the adoption of AI in cybersecurity introduces new challenges, such as adversarial attacks targeting AI models, the lack of transparency in algorithmic decision-making, and the dependence on data quality. This document reviews the current applications of AI in cybersecurity, highlighting its contributions, limitations, and future perspectives. It also explores emerging solutions to counter zero-day attacks, the development of human-AI collaborative systems for adaptive defense, and the establishment of ethical and regulatory frameworks to ensure the responsible use of AI, aimed at protecting critical systems in the long term against increasingly sophisticated threats.},

The aim of the research was to experimentally verify whether ChatGPT can maintain the protection of pseudonymized data by not maintaining the link between the anonymized part and personal data. Four requests were tested in the experiment, in which ChatGPT was gradually provided with various combinations of pseudonymized and complete data about customers and their orders. The results showed that ChatGPT does not store previous inputs and is not able to reconstruct personal data retroactively if they were not explicitly provided to it in each request. Based on the results obtained, it can be assumed that the use of ChatGPT when processing pseudonymized data does not pose a risk of violating the protection of personal data. This research seeks to contribute to the discussion on the security of generative artificial intelligence in processing sensitive data and confirms the effectiveness of pseudonymization as a mechanism for protecting personal data.},

    abstract = {A zero-day exploit is an online attack using a previously unknown software or hardware weakness before its vulnerabilities can be tackled by its creators. A zero-day exploit could result in unauthorized access, information loss, and extensive financial gains. Recent works have investigated utilizing Generative Adversarial Networks in predicting and detecting zero-day exploits. In the adversarial process, the discriminator and generator refine detection. Studies conducted between 2022 and 2024 have proved the capability of such models in detecting vulnerabilities. Nevertheless, existing GAN based methods are confronted by various challenges, such as high cost, scalability issues, unstable training, and slow responsiveness to newly emerging exploit attacks, rendering real-time detection of threats less efficient. This project proposes an improved GAN architecture tackling such problems through a hybrid approach merging Conditional or Wasserstein GANs and Reinforcement Learning, Vulnerability Intelligence, Graph Neural Networks, and Autoencoders. This stabilizes training, minimizes computation overhead, and maximizes flexibility to new exploit methods. Our model, with this architecture, will be able to provide more precise detection of zero-day exploits, strengthening cybersecurity defenses beyond existing techniques. This method is designed to be adaptive and scalable so that it can provide long-term security against evolving cyber threats.},

Non-parametric statistical methods were used to identify significant differences between groups, including Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests with Dunn-Bonferroni post hoc analysis. The findings reveal consistent differences across genders and disciplines, with males and IT students demonstrating significantly higher readiness and satisfaction with AI. Furthermore, satisfaction levels fluctuated over time, peaking in 2023 – likely influenced by the widespread adoption of tools like ChatGPT. Correlation analysis further highlighted the subtle interrelationships between constructs across different subgroups. The study underscores the importance of tailored AI education strategies and calls for targeted interventions to ensure equitable engagement with AI across diverse student populations.},

    abstract = {To enhance teaching practices and lecture strategies, online lecturers need reliable and opportunity feedback. Post-observation feedback provides opportunities for reflection, dialogue, development, and helping lecturers to improve their teaching practices. However, this poses a significant challenge in online higher education due to traditional observation procedures requiring previously trained observers, rendering them expensive and time-consuming. In addition, the observation process has human biases such as those introduced in annotated data by trained observers. Automated solutions powered by Artificial Intelligence offer a viable alternative providing consistency and affordability, delivering actionable feedback to lecturers, thereby helping to improve their pedagogical techniques and supporting student success. Hence, analyzing the video conferencing of the lecturers in online courses would help provide feedback to instructors and insights about teaching practices to institutional leadership. Therefore, this Work in Progress describes a proof of concept on a speech processing pipeline for providing post-observation feedback using Generative Artificial Intelligence to support the reflection process about online higher education teachers' practices.},

In this paper, we examine the interaction between developers of GAI models and design students, focusing on the nexus between ethics and functionality. Using a design class example, we show how GAI models can help students efficiently and responsibly explore design alternatives by quantitatively assessing their designs' novelty relative to the training data. Through the presented framework, it becomes apparent that the ethical use of GAI models will also require developers to implement specific network architectures. However, the joint interaction will greatly promote transparency in the creative process, support fair monetization of a student's intellectual property, and facilitate the development of high-quality training datasets for future GAI models. By addressing these considerations, we aim to promote the responsible use of GAI in design education and beyond.},

    abstract = {In an era where technology plays a significant role in the lives of people of all ages, adapting to rapidly advancing technology is essential. Lifelong learning, which integrates formal, non-formal, and informal education, helps learners develop skills and abilities independently. Programming skills serve as an example of lifelong learning, requiring the development of technical skills such as programming, planning, and testing, as well as communication, teamwork, and systematic thinking. This research focuses on utilizing Generative Artificial Intelligence (Generative AI) to enhance programming skills through self-directed learning combined with interactive learning. The study was conducted with 21 students enrolled in the Higher Vocational Certificate (Diploma) program in Mechatronics and Robotics. The study applied the MAR model, which consists of three stages: The motivation stage, is designed to encourage learners to engage in activities that link prior knowledge or experiences with new knowledge, thereby fostering self-directed learning motivation, such as designing personalized learning activities based on individual interests; the Activity stage, which provides opportunities for learners to use Generative AI technology for self-directed learning according to their goals and plans, enabling them to understand concepts, apply knowledge in various situations, and track their learning progress; and the Reflection and Progress stage, focusing on reviewing, analyzing, and reflecting on learning outcomes, as well as exchanging ideas and skills with peers and receiving constructive feedback. These stages were designed based on theoretical foundations and a literature review. Furthermore, the research emphasized ethical considerations in AI use, such as data privacy and societal impacts, to promote high-quality, beneficial lifelong learning. The findings showed that before the learning process, the learner had no background in programming and had never used AI technology. However, after participating in the learning activities, students became more open to learning and responded positively to the self-designed activities, which aligned with their interests and skills related to their field of study. These findings suggest that this learning process, when implemented effectively, can be applied to lifelong learning for individuals of all genders and ages.},

    abstract = {Providing rich, constructive feedback to students is essential for supporting and enhancing their learning. Recent advancements in Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly with large language models (LLMs), present new opportunities to deliver scalable, repeatable, and instant feedback, effectively making abundant a resource that has historically been scarce and costly. From a technical perspective, this approach is now feasible due to breakthroughs in AI and Natural Language Processing (NLP). While the potential educational benefits are compelling, implementing these technologies also introduces a host of ethical considerations that must be thoughtfully addressed. One of the core advantages of AI systems is their ability to automate routine and mundane tasks, potentially freeing up human educators for more nuanced work. However, the ease of automation risks a “tyranny of the majority”, where the diverse needs of minority or unique learners are overlooked, as they may be harder to systematize and less straightforward to accommodate. Ensuring inclusivity and equity in AI-generated feedback, therefore, becomes a critical aspect of responsible AI implementation in education. The process of developing machine learning models that produce valuable, personalized, and authentic feedback also requires significant input from human domain experts. Decisions around whose expertise is incorporated, how it is captured, and when it is applied have profound implications for the relevance and quality of the resulting feedback. Additionally, the maintenance and continuous refinement of these models are necessary to adapt feedback to evolving contextual, theoretical, and student-related factors. Without ongoing adaptation, feedback risks becoming obsolete or mismatched with the current needs of diverse student populations. Addressing these challenges is essential not only for ethical integrity but also for building the operational trust needed to integrate AI-driven systems as valuable tools in contemporary education. Thoughtful planning and deliberate choices are needed to ensure that these solutions truly benefit all students, allowing AI to support an inclusive and dynamic learning environment.},

We first reviewed the theoretical foundations of multimodality in human learning, encompassing its concept and history, dual coding theory and multimedia theory, VARK multimodality, and multimodal assessment (see Section II-A). After that, we revisited the essential components of AGI, particularly focusing on the multimodal nature of AGI that distinguished it from artificial narrow intelligence. Based on its conversational functionality, multimodal AGI is considered an educational agent already tested in various educational situations (see Section II-B). How significant text, image, audio, and video modalities are for education, the technological backgrounds of AGI for analyzing and generating them, and educational applications of artificial intelligence (AI) for each modality were thoroughly reviewed (Sections III–VI). Finally, we comprehensively investigated the ethics of AGI in education, originating from the ethics of AI and specified in three strands: first, data privacy and ethical integrity, second, explainability, transparency, and fairness, and third, responsibility and decision-making. Practical implementation of ethical AGI frameworks in education was reviewed (see Section VII). This article also discusses the implications for learning theories, derived operational design principles, current research gaps, practical constraints and institutional readiness, and future directions (see Section VIII). This exploration aims to provide an advanced understanding of the intersection between AI, multimodality, and education, setting a foundation for future research and development.},

Meanwhile, with the help of deep learning, multimodal emotion recognition technology has advanced rapidly. However, deep learning-based multimodal emotion recognition still has some drawbacks, such as requiring a large amount of training data, inconsistencies in the quantity and quality of data within datasets, and heterogeneity among different modalities in multimodal fusion. To address these issues, we propose a multimodal emotion recognition framework based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which enhances feature representation and reduces heterogeneity in multimodal fusion. Finally, we achieve promising experimental results on the RAVDESS dataset.},

    abstract = {With the rapid development of Generative AI technology, the detection and governance of fake news has become a hot topic of concern in academia and society. The wide dissemination of fake news not only disrupts the public's information perception but also triggers social phenomena such as information epidemics, posing significant challenges to social stability, political environment and public health. Especially driven by social media, the speed and breadth of information dissemination have greatly intensified the spread of fake news. The research findings indicate that Generative AI mainly focuses on the optimization of natural language processing and deep learning technologies, providing new technical support for the detection of fake news. Meanwhile, the role of social media platforms and information dissemination pathways have become the focus of scholars' attention. However, issues such as the dissemination of cross-platform fake news, the practical application of generative AI, and the accuracy and robustness of algorithms remain the main challenges in current research. In this regard, this article suggests that future research should further optimize large-scale language models, promote innovation in multimodal fake news detection technology, and strengthen research on cross platform fake news dissemination mechanisms, in order to provide more accurate and effective technical support for fake news governance and alleviate its negative impact on society.},

However, complex spatiotemporal dependencies and dynamic interactions remain challenging technical issues that require urgent resolution. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a GAN-based multi-module fusion prediction model. By integrating multiple architectures-including a graph attention network, a Transformer encoder, and a temporal convolutional network-the model simultaneously optimizes spatial interactions, temporal dependencies, and trajectory feature modeling. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with baseline methods such as CV, CS-LSTM, and TCN-LSTM, the proposed model significantly improves prediction accuracy by reducing the average displacement error and final displacement error by 24.38% and 14.46%, respectively, thereby fully validating its effectiveness in complex traffic scenarios.},

Especially those pipelines, which by nature, are producing more profound changes in organizational productivity, work quality, error reduction, and overall end customer experience enhancement fronts. In this context, our research focuses on examining and analyzing modern-day GAI applications, product and service generation, marketing and user/customer experience-related business pipelines, and current practices, across a range of domains, on extending current academic and practical use basis knowledge of different applications and uses of GAI in context of many different industrial application areas.

This method employed both the Newton-Raphson method and PQ decomposition to calculate the power flow within the power system. Subsequently, artificial intelligence techniques were utilized to evaluate the reliability of the results by analyzing error characteristics. This approach differed from traditional artificial intelligence methods by incorporating generative adversarial network-based data set expansion technology and a multi-scale fusion neural network model.

However, managing T2D is challenging because blood glucose levels fluctuate due to diet, exercise, and patients’ idiosyncrasies. Approaches such as real-time monitoring, predictive modeling, and personalized treatment have been among the major breakthroughs in the field. Still, their holistic integration for dynamic dosing and dietary optimization has remained largely unexplored. This research analyzes insights from recent research that reveal different methodologies such as machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and predictive models in improving diabetes management outcomes. Some studies showed up to 1.5% HbA1c reduction and time-in-range improvement by 20% to 25% due to artificial intelligence (AI) driven interventions. The accuracy of blood glucose prediction in these studies ranged from 85% to 95%, thus showing that these models can control blood sugar levels at any given moment. The preliminary results show that dynamic dosing models combined with dietary recommendations may achieve a 0.8% to 1.2% decrease in HbA1c and a 10% to 15% improvement in overall glycemic control. This study investigates the applications of Digital Twin (DT) technology, Reinforcement Learning (RL), and Generative AI (Gen AI) in diabetic control systems. The proposed model adopts these strategies to illustrate the possibility of connecting the existing research gaps and prepare for future developments on adaptive AI-powered framework for diabetes care.},

However, with the breadth of use cases and applications made available with the advancements in large language models (LLMs), there are increasing signs that attitudes towards LLM-based generative AI may be context or use-case dependent. We examine the contextualised trust of individuals in AI, the support for using AI, and AI adoption intentions in a survey experiment ($\mathrm{N}=306$) across three contexts (reasons): technical, mental health, and creative assistance. Participants read ostensible news articles about AI use in one of these three contexts, and completed a survey on their resultant and previous attitudes. The results show that trust and adoption were significantly higher for technical assistance, and lower for creative assistance and mental health assistance. However, support for using AI for mental health assistance was significantly higher than creative assistance, and comparable to technical assistance. Contextualised trust and support also significantly predicted AI adoption intentions, above and beyond trust scores towards AI in general. Our study suggests that contextualised attitudes towards specific AI products appear to be sufficiently differentiated from (general) AI attitudes, and instances where AI is used for technical reasons, as opposed to creative or mental health reasons, garners more favourable attitudes.},

An analytical literature review was conducted within the Johns Hopkins University Sheridan Libraries Catalyst databases to support stated objectives around selected NIST common language terms related to safety and security. The resulting analysis demonstrates that, in the U.S. and on an international scale, selected AIMD literature and guidance may not include or consistently use critical, integrated terms for AIMD security or safety, such as NISTIR 8312's four principles of artificial intelligence explainability.

Once relegated to speculative fiction, AI now emerges as a practical co-creator, offering tools capable of generating compelling narratives from minimal input. This study explores the evolving role of AI in screenwriting by evaluating story outputs generated by Bard AI against those written by human screenwriters. Using a structured, two-phase research design, the investigation compares the narratives based on five qualitative variables: plot, narration, character development, dialogue, and cultural relevance. A three-tiered input strategy—ranging from basic to extended prompts—was adopted to assess the AI's creative flexibility and responsiveness. Results show that while AI-generated stories demonstrate coherence, stylistic fluency, and efficient scene setting, they fall short in emotional depth, cultural nuance, and imaginative progression. Human-written scripts, though less structured, excel in dialogue and subtextual character portrayal. The findings highlight the potential of AI as a valuable tool in early-stage ideation and structural support, especially for Gen Z creators, while reaffirming the irreplaceable role of human imagination in storytelling. This research advocates for a hybrid screenwriting model, where AI serves as a creative assistant rather than a substitute for human authorship.},

The Hybrid Adaptive AI Security Framework (HAASF), a novel framework that combines reinforcement learning (RL), generative adversarial networks (GANs), and swarm intelligence (SI) to provide strong, adaptive security for IoT ecosystems, is what this paper offers. HAASF employs a DQN-based RL defender to acquire dynamic defense prioritization, GANs for strong proactive learning through realistic attack model generation, and PSO-induced SI for IoT node distributed threat mitigation. Evaluated on an NS-3 simulated testbed smart home with 50 devices of diverse hardware, HAASF was compared with five types of attacks, i.e., DDoS, Man-in-the-Middle, Sybil, Data Tampering, and Replay attacks. Against baselines—single RL, signature-based IDS, and CNN-based anomaly detection—HAASF achieved a 95% detection rate, 4% false positive rate, 1.9-second response time, and 40 mW energy consumption. These are HAASF's capabilities in new threat detection, predicting attack patterns, and resource optimization combined against traditional IoT defenses. Through the combination of hybrid AI approaches, HAASF offers scalable, energy-efficient, and responsive security upon which scalable IoT systems can be based in increasingly interconnected and vulnerable systems.},

Specifically, our approach disentangles X-ray angiographies into background and vessel components, leveraging medical prior knowledge. A specialized predictor then learns to map the interrelationships between these components. Additionally, a vessel semantic-guided generator and a corresponding loss function are introduced to enhance the visual fidelity of generated images. Experimental results on the XCAD dataset demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our CAS-GAN, achieving a FID of 5.87 and a MMD of 0.016.

Recent studies have leveraged artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for malware detection and classification. However, applying such approaches, particularly deep learning (DL) techniques, to mobile malware detection poses significant challenges. These challenges arise from the difficulty of collecting large quantities of mobile malware samples and the inherent class imbalance in the collected datasets. To tackle these issues and enhance the performance of machine learning (ML) and DL detection models, we propose novel detection models based on a generative adversarial network (GAN). Furthermore, our approach not only employs a conditional tabular GAN (CTGAN) for data augmentation to explore the impact of augmentation but also identifies the optimal multiplication factor for achieving the best results. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed data augmentation approach significantly improves the performance of mobile malware detection models, especially those based on DL. We have notably figured out that doubling the original dataset is sufficient to enhance the performance of ML models, whereas DL models require additional data to achieve optimal results. Hence, our proposed mechanism is an effective solution for improving mobile malware detection.},

Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was employed as a robust statistical technique to analyze the impact of various factors on college students' perceptions and attitudes regarding the use of generative AI for academic work. The study's constructs were assessed for reliability and validity using Cronbach's Alpha, Average Variance Extracted (AVE), and the Heterotrait-Monotrait (HTMT) ratio. The findings indicate that the complexity and intensity of academic tasks, students' engagement with generative AI platforms, and the support they receive from educational stakeholders significantly influence their attitudes toward using these platforms for academic assignments. Conversely, students' perceptions of generative AI are heavily shaped by the support systems available to them and their understanding of the potential risks associated with using such technologies for their assignments and projects. This research contributes to the ongoing discussion about the ethical and practical implications of AI in education, providing valuable insights into best practices for integrating AI technologies to enhance learning while upholding academic integrity.},

This paper provides a detailed review about the most prominent GAN models that have shaped the development of more realistic synthetic images. The aim of this paper is to help researchers review the most significant advancements and gain insights regarding their basics, working, limitations and future scope. The major driving force for the rapid development of GANs is the extensive work done to solve training instability, mode collapse, and visual artifact issues. These issues make training a GAN a difficult process. To address this concern, we chose six pioneering models for in-depth analysis—StyleGAN, StyleGAN-XL, StarGAN, Slicing Adversarial Network (SAN), Diffusion GAN, GigaGAN. These models shattered previous record FID scores and results in unprecedented image generation performance, fundamentally shifting the benchmark of excellence in the field. They have shown to leverage new architectures that advance the state of generative AI. We emphasize their performance regarding the accuracy, variance, and realism of images, as well as the potential impact of these technologies on diverse fields from medical imaging to deepfake detection, object recognition, image editing, and material science. We extend our review by providing a model idea that could help generate finer emotion conditioned images inspired by StarGAN-XL and StyleGAN architecture.},

Using lag sequence analysis, the study analyzes reflective behavior patterns based on 66 pre-service teachers' reflective texts on microteaching. The results indicate that generative AI-supported teacher comments significantly optimize pre-service teachers' reflective behavior patterns, particularly in terms of breadth and depth. The experimental group's reflective behaviors covered multiple dimensions, including teaching content (CW), teaching process and methods (PW), classroom atmosphere (AW), and teaching evaluation and feedback (EW), demonstrating comprehensiveness. Additionally, their reflective behaviors formed problem chains, such as "teaching content → teaching process → classroom atmosphere" (CW→PW→AW), reflecting stronger logic and depth. In contrast, the control group's reflective behaviors primarily focused on basic teaching skills (BW) and teaching process and methods (PW), with insufficient attention to classroom atmosphere (AW) and teaching evaluation and feedback (EW). Their reflections were more superficial and limited. Based on these findings, the study proposes recommendations to optimize pre-service teachers' reflective behavior patterns, aiming to enhance their microteaching reflection abilities and, consequently, their teaching competence development.},

This study addresses the class imbalance challenge using generative artificial intelligence (GAI), employing a conditional generative adversarial network (CTGAN) to generate synthetic data for training machine learning models. Following data augmentation, six representative machine learning models, including Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), AdaBoost, XGBoost, Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and LightGBM, are evaluated and compared using two real-world datasets from Taiwan and the USA. The CTGAN-based synthetic data generation approach is further compared with alternative methods, including the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) and Gaussian copula data generators. Experimental results demonstrate that the workflow combining CTGAN and LightGBM achieves the highest prediction performance, measured by F1 score, on both datasets. It also outperforms baseline methods from previous studies, highlighting the effectiveness of GAI in addressing the class imbalance problem in corporate bankruptcy prediction.},

    abstract = {The development of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly generative AI tools, has significantly transformed higher education. This study examined the key challenges encountered by college lecturers in the AI environment and the practical solutions they offered for these challenges. Seventeen heads of departments or academic units from a teacher education college participated in this study. Data were collected through a video-recorded focus group interview and supplemented reports. Data were analyzed inductively using the constant comparison method to identify recurring themes and patterns across the participants. The findings revealed five central challenges faced by college lecturers: (1) Assessment integrity that includes difficulties in verifying student authenticity, increasing plagiarism risks, and diminishing academic originality; (2) AI adoption resistance characterized by reluctance or hesitancy in embracing AI technologies stemming from limited familiarity and a lack of confidence; (3) Pedagogical adaptation imperative that necessitates the revision of instructional methodologies and a redefinition of the lecturer's role in the context of AI integration; (4) Technological literacy disparities that refer to gaps in digital literacy among both faculty and students, compound by unequal familiarity with AI tools; and (5) Limited institutional resources that result in restricted access to advanced AI tools and insufficient professional development opportunities. In response to these challenges, the participants proposed several potential solutions: fostering transparent and ethical student utilization of AI tools, implementing alternative assessment strategies focused on personal and critical thinking skills, enhancing institutional support through ICT centers, offering structured training programs, and ensuring equitable access to AI platforms. So, colleges need to open dialogue and collaboration among faculty members to develop shared guidelines and best practices for the ethical and effective use of AI in academic settings. In addition, teaching should focus more on thinking critically and personal skills, which are especially essential in the AI environment.},

At present, most of the objects converted from sketches are relatively simple shapes, such as faces, human postures, animal postures, shoes, and bags. At present, sketch conversion-based work is difficult to handle images with complex texture structures, making it challenging to solve the task of image conversion for clothing sketches. Additionally, the lack of clothing datasets is also a difficult problem to solve. In order to solve the above problems, this paper proposes using an edge detection algorithm to generate clothing simulation sketches in reverse, solving the problem of missing clothing sketch datasets. Then, combined with generative adversarial networks in the field of artificial intelligence, the Cloth Sketch GAN (CSG) network framework is proposed. It improves the generator and discriminator on the basis of the pix2pix network, and enhances the image generation effect by adding an attention module in the generator of the U-Net network structure. Two scales of discriminators are used to discriminate the images separately, and multiple layers of feature extraction are introduced based on the two scales of discriminators. The design of the feature matching loss function and perception loss function is added to make the generated images more realistic and clear, thus completing the conversion from clothing sketch to clothing image. Applied research. Finally, experiments were conducted on the clothing dataset constructed in this article, and the results showed that Cloth Sketch GAN had a significant improvement in the performance of generating clothing images. Moreover, with the improved network proposed in this article, the task of converting clothing sketches to real clothing images can be effectively accomplished on the clothing dataset.},

This paper begins by analysing the current status of standardisation in the network AI domain, and next elaborates on the major shortcomings of the current approaches for natively setting up network AI services. On this basis, we present the concept of Native Network Generative AI (NNGAI), which builds on and further advances the concept of native AI for telecom networks. To formulate the paradigm of NNGAI, we first devise the network architecture, and then finally the underlying logical flow of network services to realize NNGAI by carefully inserting generative AI technologies into both the architecture and the service flow of 6G networks.},

Nonetheless, a growing interdisciplinary interest in AI governance is evident, with notable contributions from multi-disciplinary journals and open-access publications. Analysis of publications per country revealed that while the United States and China dominate AI governance research, European countries, along with the United Kingdom, also contribute significantly with a focus on specific systems restricted by the Act. Dominant research themes include ethical considerations, privacy concerns, and the growing impact of generative AI, such as ChatGPT. Notably, education, healthcare, and worker management are prominent application domains. Keyword network analysis highlights education, ethics, and ChatGPT as central keywords, underscoring the importance of these areas in current AI governance research. Subsequently, a comprehensive literature review was undertaken based on the bibliometric analysis findings to identify research trends, challenges, and insights within the categories of the EU AI Act. This review revealed critical gaps in research concerning regulated AI systems, highlighting the need for more focused research aligned with the Act’s regulatory framework. The findings provide valuable insights for researchers and policymakers, informing future research directions and contributing to developing comprehensive AI governance frameworks beyond the EU AI Act. Crucially, the study identifies a significant lag between AI technological advancement and the development of policy and regulation, especially concerning specific AI systems categorized as high-risk by the EU AI Act.},

The research involved 76 high school students from scientific tracks, who were shown with AI-generated personalized images portraying themselves working in STEM-related professions. Results indicate that self-envisioning in STEM fields increased for both genders after the intervention, with the effect being four times greater for female students. In engineering fields specifically, a significant increase in selfenvisioning was observed among female students, while no significant impact was found for male students-likely due to the historical underrepresentation of women and the influence of gender stereotypes on career aspirations. These findings demonstrate the potential of AI-generated personalized images as a novel tool to reduce gender disparities in STEM.

This paper presents the results of a research exploring the impact of AI on software engineering/development, focusing on aspects of automated code generation and human-AI collaboration. The use of Generative AI tools, in particular AI chatbots ChatGPT, Gemini and Bing (today Copilot), has been tested on use cases of varying levels of difficulty. The results demonstrate outstanding capabilities of the tested tools in streamlining tasks and providing assistance, but show that these tools remain most effective when integrated into a workflow under the supervision of qualified engineers/developers. The paper also presents the results of a survey conducted among software engineers/developers highly proficient in using AI. The survey indicates that most of the respondents believe that AI has a positive impact on the productivity of software engineers/developers, with more than half of respondents believing that AI will not replace software engineers/developers but is a tool that helps them be more productive. Survey respondents particularly emphasized the importance of ethics, privacy, and data security.},

From their initial spontaneous application in education, we are gradually moving toward a more thoughtful and systematic approach. To better understand the current state of AI utilization in education, we conducted our own EU Code Week 2024 activity titled “Programming an Animated Music Clip”. The aim of this activity was to foster positive attitudes toward programming among students and teachers, enhance their multimedia literacy, and encourage creativity using artificial intelligence tools. The outcome of this activity is a publicly available collection of animated music clips created by students and teachers from primary, secondary, and higher education institutions. In the article, we analyse the impact of AI utilization on the final projects of the authors. The analysis was carried out using automated tools (Formal Concept Analysis, Dr. Scratch, custom automated tool, R program) and human evaluation. We examined the projects from various perspectives, such as the artificial intelligence tools used, the proportion of multimedia created by humans versus AI, the programming complexity of the projects, and the level of creativity of the authors. In the subsequent section of the article, we present the identified relationships between these aspects and provide recommendations for integrating AI into the teaching process.},

    abstract = {Deep learning is a type of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that has grown quickly and is now widely used in computer software. As the need for deep learning algorithms that can handle more complicated tasks keeps growing very quickly, the improvements in how efficient and productive these algorithms can be utilized for identifying data poisoning is an important step. Data poisoning refers to altering the legitimate data using various techniques and fabricating the expected results. The poisoning will affect the quality of predictions and reliability of the contents generated. The data sensitive applications which rely on classification models for deriving conclusions will be affected by poisoning resulting in unrealistic conclusions and misguided inferences. Continuous occurrence of poorly classified data and unrealistic conclusions will affect the reliability of the system making it less trustworthy. This research looks into long lasting effects of poisoning attacks, which target the training data used in deep learning and assess the way a deep learning model classifies information. Experiments were done to measure the accuracy of different machine learning algorithms in effectively detecting poisoned data. The evaluations were done using KNN, SVM and Logistic Regression models. The analysis concludes that KNN offers better prediction compared to SVM and Logistic Regression. Logistic regression offers less accurate predictions making it unfit for poisoning detection. Proper classification of poisoned data will help research community and users to be aware of legitimacy of data and thereby help them to choose the right data and information for processing, analytics, and deriving conclusions. This will greatly improve the performance and trustworthiness of related models including generative AI systems and makes the learning process un biased which will highly benefit the research community in general.},

The algorithm effectively integrates multimodal cultural data such as text, image, and audio by constructing a cultural feature fusion module, a dynamic adversarial training mechanism, and a semantic consistency constraint module. The experiment uses public cultural data sets and self-built characteristic cultural corpora, covering scenes such as poetry creation, film and television poster design, and music melody generation. In the poetry generation task, the BLEU-4 score of poetry generated by MM-GAN reached 0.45, which is higher than the 0.32 of traditional GAN and other baseline models. In the film and television poster design experiment, the average perceptual similarity between the generated poster and the target style is 0.88, far exceeding the comparison algorithm. In terms of music melody generation, the average harmonic rationality score of the generated melody is 4.2 (out of 5 points). The results show that MM-GAN is significantly superior to traditional algorithms in terms of cultural creation quality, style fit and semantic coherence, and can effectively assist cultural creation and dissemination, providing a new path for the development of this field.},

Traditional academic frameworks often struggle to keep pace with industry demands, leaving some students underprepared for real-world challenges. This study identifies three core issues within STEM education: how to update curricula that lag technological advancements, limited opportunities for practical, hands-on application of skills, and constrained academic timeframes that limit the depth of transformative learning experiences.To address these issues, this research explores the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools and Agile methodologies to bridge the gap between academic theory and industry practice in the field of product development. By examining two case studies - the development of an AI-driven media analysis tool for the United Nations International Computing Centre (UNICC) and AI-focused capstone projects within a Management and Systems graduate program. We show how applying Generative AI and Agile technologies can enhance curriculum relevance, expand real-world skill development opportunities, and optimize learning within semester-based time constraints. AI enables adaptive, personalized learning and automates routine tasks, while Agile’s iterative approach fosters engagement and adaptability in real-world problem-solving scenarios. AI is also a productive basis for product development in the integrative experience of a capstone. This research shows how combining AI and Agile provides an integrated framework for modernizing educational practices, equipping students with essential industry-relevant skills for a technology-driven workforce.},

As the need for attractive, professional, and easily accessible promotional content increases, generative artificial intelligence (generative AI) technology is a potential solution to support the efficiency and quality of visual design. This study explores how design thinking and generative AI can be used to create attractive and professional visual content. This study uses a design thinking method with seven stages including understand, observe, define point of view, ideate, prototype, test, and reflect. Each step uses specific tools such as persona profile canvas, feedback capture grids, and retrospective boards, as well as generative AI tools used in prototypes such as Canva AI, Prome AI, Leonardo AI and others to create faster and more optimal designs. The results of the study show that the use of AI in promotional materials significantly improves the efficiency and branding of MSMEs, enabling the production of high-quality content at a lower cost. However, challenges remain, related to the limited scope of the study which only focuses on one sector, namely Muslim fashion MSMEs and the lack of AI's ability to understand the nuances of brand identity in depth. This study contributes to increasing the understanding of the synergy between design thinking and generative AI, as it can provide practical guidance for MSMEs in optimizing digital marketing, and suggests future research that focuses more on assisting MSMEs directly in implementing AI in their businesses.},

    abstract = {The introduction of synthetic intellect in the processes and procedures also termed artificial intelligence (AI) has risen as a disruptive catalyst across many different sectors. AI has found widespread application in automated systems, financing, and healthcare. With the increasing use of AI, models and algorithms have started surpassing the significant ideals of human performance. The significance of generative AI (GenAI) lies in its concentration on the realms of knowledge work and creative labor, which encompasses a significant number of humans, totalling billions. Procreative AI or GenAI has the potential of enhancing the efficiency and creativity of people by at least 10%. It can also improve their speed, efficiency, and overall capabilities to some extent. GenAI possesses the capability of generating immense economic value up to trillions of dollars. AI systems used to be rule-based and had limited capabilities. The emergence of algorithms for deep learning toward the century’s end paved the way for more sophisticated GenAI models. GenAI is a specialized branch of AI that specifically concentrates on the production of novel content, including audio, video, and writings, through the utilization of artificially intelligent deep learning algorithms. Implementing AI for decision- making in sustainable project life cycle operations remains difficult. Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has empowered developers to engage with generative algorithms, effectively transforming natural language queries into code for diverse programming languages. Highly advanced technologies such as Codacy and OpenAI Codex are widely utilized to assist LLMs and their adoption is steadily growing. GenAI solutions leverage aspects such as “completion” to significantly improve the creation of software. AI is extensively used in a number of manufacturing organizations, including those in healthcare, finance, robotics, and automation. However, using AI to make decisions in sustainable project life cycle management is still a difficult undertaking. The present research explores the utilization of AI techniques for decision-making to promote sustainable operations throughout the various phases of a project life cycle. This chapter compares the existing GenAI project life cycles and also suggests the practical framework, as also provides the various futuristic recommendations for sustainable project life cycles.},

These hands-on inspections are largely conducted visually and documentation is largely manual using analog documentation methods. The results are a heterogeneous data collection and subjective decisions regarding the choice of measures.Modern technologies like artificial intelligence, augmented reality and BIM promise enormous potential to modernize this process by making it more objective, reliable and economical. This paper presents digital methods for bridge inspection based on the experiences from two research projects of the Federal Highway and Transport Research Institute (BASt) with Ruhr University Bochum and Hochtief Engineering GmbH Vicon including demonstrators developed with practitioners. These investigations focused on detection and localization of visual detectable defects, but also their connection to the digital twin bridge. Furthermore, an ongoing successor study on the chronology of image data sets and their predictive potential for structural damage is presented.},

    abstract = {Today, numerical controls (CNC) are the standard for the control of machine tools and industrial robots in production and enable highly flexible and efficient production, especially for frequently changing production tasks. A numerical control has discrete inputs and outputs. Within the NC channel, however, it is necessary to analytically describe curves for the calculation of the position setpoints and the jerk limitation. The resulting change between discrete and continuous description forms and the considerable restrictions in the parallelisation of the interpolation of continuous curves within the NC channel lead to a performance overhead that limits the performance of the NC channel with regard to the calculation of new position setpoints. This can lead to a drop in production speed and thus to longer production times. To solve this problem, we propose a new approach in this paper. This is based on the use of deep generative models and allows the direct generation of interpolated toolpaths without calculation of continuous curves and subsequent discretization. The generative models are being trained to create curves of certain types such as linear and parabolic curves or splines directly as discrete point sequences. This approach is very well feasible with regard to its parallelization and reduces the computing effort within the NC channel. First results with straight lines and parabolic curves show the feasibility of this new approach for the generation of CNC toolpaths.},

    abstract = {Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, as the core technology in Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications, such as self-driving vehicles, make important decisions by performing a variety of data classification or prediction tasks. Attacks on data or algorithms in AI applications can lead to misclassification or misprediction, which can fail the applications. For each dataset separately, the parameters of ML algorithms should be tuned to reach a desirable classification or prediction accuracy. Typically, ML experts tune the parameters empirically, which can be time consuming and does not guarantee the optimal result. To this end, some research suggests an analytical approach to tune the ML parameters for maximum accuracy. However, none of the works consider the ML performance under attack in their tuning process. This paper proposes an analytical framework for tuning the ML parameters to be secure against attacks, while keeping its accuracy high. The framework finds the optimal set of parameters by defining a novel objective function, which takes into account the test results of both ML accuracy and its security against attacks. For validating the framework, an AI application is implemented to recognize whether a subject's eyes are open or closed, by applying k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) algorithm on her Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. In this application, the number of neighbors (k) and the distance metric type, as the two main parameters of kNN, are chosen for tuning. The input data perturbation attack, as one of the most common attacks on ML algorithms, is used for testing the security of the application. Exhaustive search approach is used to solve the optimization problem. The experiment results show k = 43 and cosine distance metric is the optimal configuration of kNN for the EEG dataset, which leads to 83.75% classification accuracy and reduces the attack success rate to 5.21%.},

In this paper, we introduce an unsupervised representation learning by designing and implementing deep neural networks (DNNs) in combination with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The main idea behind the proposed method, which causes the superiority of this method over others is representation learning via the generative models and encoder networks altogether. In this research, encoders are utilized in addition to the generative models to help the more features to be extracted. It is shown that the proposed method not only help feature extraction but accelerate and improve the performance of the learning in GANs which lead to better feature extraction.

The reason is that these conventional assisting devices only address the obstacle avoidance problem. They do not provide visually impaired people with a global perception of the surrounding environment. In this article, a new generative adversarial network (GAN) model is developed to effectively transform the ground images into the tactile signal, which can be displayed by an off-the-shelf vibration device. The algorithm module and the hardware are integrated into a portable device, which provides visually impaired people with effective surrounding perception capability. In addition, a visual-tactile cross-modal data set is constructed to train the proposed deep-learning architecture. Experimental results show that the proposed system can help visually impaired people sense the ground and bring a better traveling experience for them. Note to Practitioners—This article presents a portable device that provides tactile recognition assistance for visually impaired people. Such a technology can be extensively used in tactile mouse and white cane. The developed technology can be extensively used for various industrial applications, such as surrounding monitoring and manipulation. The proposed work demonstrates the promising ability of artificial intelligence in healthcare applications.

    abstract = {Night vision technology provides an important means for night observation by using infrared radiation of the target as the imaging basis. Recently, artificial neural network (ANN) has become a research hotspot. Realizing the classification and recognition of infrared images by ANN is helpful to the intelligent development of night vision technology, as well as improve the accurate judgment of the surrounding environment by unmanned vehicles at night, and better ensure the safety of people and vehicles. However, the existing infrared image data set contains a small number of images, and the types of scenes and targets presented in the images are single, which cannot support the training of ANN. ANN cannot obtain the classification function of infrared images through full learning. In this paper, an infrared image generative model based on generative adversarial network (GAN) is proposed, which can convert the existing visible light data set into the infrared version of the data set in a short time, and then solve the problem of lack of infrared image data sets. To train ResNet by infrared version data set can realize its classification function for infrared images. The model with the existing image generative model is compared through several evaluation indexes. The results show that the model is more effective in generative infrared images. Inputting ImageNet data set into this model can generate ImageNet infrared version data set. ResNet trained by this data set has a classification and recognition accuracy of 91.28%, which is higher than the experimental results of existing image generative models. The design and implementation of infrared image generative model in this paper promote the application of artificial intelligence and depth learning in night vision technology and other fields.},

For example, shellfish growing areas may be impacted by harmful algal blooms or runoff from land that increases turbidity, lowers salinity, or introduces contaminants. Shellfish resource managers in the Chesapeake Bay are especially concerned with sources of bacteria from land such as failing onsite waste systems, failing wastewater infrastructure, and concentrated animal feeding operations. There is an urgent need for remote sensing of water quality indicators beyond chlorophyll-a and suspended sediments to augment field sampling programs. Artificial Intelligence trained with simultaneous in situ and satellite observations is explored in preparation for future hyperspectral satellite missions, which offer potential to detect additional water quality indicators not previously possible. This first step identifies and develops a method to harmonize disparate, unlinked aquatic datasets to derive information about where water quality is likely degraded.},

The generative adversarial network is introduced into the noise interference suppression algorithm.Based on the improved generative adversarial network model, the VLF noise interference suppression algorithm is studied. The generation model with strong learning ability is used to improve the accuracy of expected signal frequency estimation in the spectrum of noisy signal, and further improve the signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio in the signal bandwidth.

While existing algorithms excel in this task, creating and formatting virtual environments is a costly and time-consuming process. Thus, there is an opportunity for automating this labor intensive process by leveraging recent development in computer vision. Recent development in deep generative models, especially GANs, has spurred much interest in the computer vision domain for synthesizing realistic images. GANs combine backpropagation with a competitive process involving a pair networks, called Generative Network G and Discriminative Network D, in which G generate artificial images and D classifies it into real or artificial image categories. As the training proceeds, G learns to generate realistic images to confuse D [1]. In this work, a convolutional architecture based on GAN, specifically Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN) has been implemented to train a generative model that can produce good quality images of human faces at scale. CelebFaces Attributes Dataset (CelebA) has been used to train the DCGAN model. Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), that measures the structural and contextual similarity of two images, has been used for quantitative evaluation of the trained DCGAN model. Obtained results shows that the quality of generated images is quite similar to the high quality images of the CelebA dataset.},

In particular, social computing was significantly influenced by the recent advances of artificial intelligence (AI). However, the conventional technologies of AI have various drawbacks in dealing with complicated and dynamic problems. Such deficiency can be rectified by hybrid human-artificial intelligence (H-AI), which integrates both human intelligence and AI into one unity, forming a new enhanced intelligence. H-AI in dealing with social problems shows some advantages over the conventional AI. This article firstly reviews the latest research progresses of AI in social computing. Secondly, it summarizes typical challenges AI faces in social computing, which motivate the necessity to introduce H-AI to tackle social-oriented problems. Finally, we discuss the concept of H-AI and propose a holistic architecture of H-AI in social computing, which consists of three layers: object layer, intelligent processing layer, and application layer. The proposed architecture shows that H-AI has significant advantages over AI in solving social problems.},

However, it is difficult to build labeled network flow data sets for training machine learning and deep learning models. In this paper, we propose a novel reinforcement learning (RL) powered generative adversarial network (GAN) model named NF-GAN for network flow generation. The generator of NF-GAN is designed as a stochastic policy model to generate labeled network flow data. In terms of the discriminator, a check reward is integrated into the network reward to capture the correlations among attributes. Experiment results demonstrate that the majority of the generated flows conform to the strict network protocols of the standard OSI stack, and the success rate of network flows generation achieves 99.96%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time of applying RL powered GAN on network flow generation tasks.},

Because it is difficult to label abnormal data, most of the supervised methods consumed a lot of manpower and obtained low performance and generality. Inspired by this motivation, this paper proposes a semi-supervised method for anomaly detection in video frames based on GAN (Generative Adversarial Network), in which only normal data was used as the training sample. The quality gap between the predicted frame and the ground truth is used as the basis to determine whether it is abnormal. Moreover, the mathematical morphology approach was adopted to locate the anomaly area in the frames. Experiments show that our method can successfully detect abnormal frames in video and can also locate the area where abnormal behavior occurs in frames.},

Especially, generative adversarial network is adopted in the field of image processing, such as image style transfer, image restoration, image super-resolution and so on. Although generative adversarial networks show remarkable success in image generation, training process is usually unstable and trained models collapse where many of the generated images may contain the same color or texture pattern. In this paper, the network of generator and discriminator are modified, and the residual block is added to the generative adversarial network architecture to learn better image features. To reduce the loss of image feature during training and get more features to stabilize image generation, we use feature matching to minimize feature loss between the real and generated images for stable training. In the experiment, performance improvement can be obtained by adopting our proposed method, which is also better than some state-of-the-art methods.},

    abstract = {Applications of artificial intelligence in medical imaging include classification, segmentation, and treatment planning. Using current deep-learning techniques, developing these systems requires large amounts of labelled training data. Obtaining this data is challenging due to costs, required expertise, inconsistency of imaging procedures and formatting, and patient privacy concerns. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) may alleviate some of these issues by supplying realistic artificial medical images. In this study, we trained progressively growing (PG)GAN to synthesize full-sized computed tomography (CT) images and succeeded. Performance of the PGGAN was evaluated using Fréchet Inception Distance (FID), Inception Score (IS), and Precision (P) and Recall (R). These metrics were calculated for generated, training, and validation images. The influence of dataset size was explored by varying the number of samples used to calculate each metric; this affected FID, P, and R, but not IS, which has obvious implications for comparing studies. The FID between artificial CT images from PGGAN and real validation images was 42; interestingly, FID between real training and validation images was 24. This suggests that a further reduction of 18 could be achieved by improving the generative model. Overall, artificial CT images generated by PGGAN were almost indistinguishable from real images to the human eye, although computational metrics could identify differences between them. In future work, GANs may be deployed to augment data for training medical AI systems.},

Our findings suggest that XAI can improve model performance, instill trust in the users, and assist users in decision-making.

We discuss the evaluation of XAI results because it is an important step for maximizing the value of AI-based clinical decision support systems.

    abstract = {How will national cybersecurity stakeholders react to increasingly sophisticated artificial intelligence (AI) products in the decision-making loop? Diverse AI applications, already a component of military operations, stand to further revolutionize threat-intelligence analytics, curation, and presentation in years to come. In doing so, they portend heightened efficiency and higher tempos of security operations while minimizing risk potential. And yet, challenges abound. AI inputs to deliberative processes may be perceived as more or less robust, accurate, or generalizable according to a range of factors that influence decision-makers. Then these habits and preferences might be reintroduced to the information loop in several ways, as the algorithm, the design/implementation process, and institutions adapt to accommodate the human element. Malicious actors are even likely to target this action-reaction loop to influence AI systems. This two-phase cycle is perhaps most worrisome in relation to cyber conflict, where informational ambiguity, functionally diverse workforces, and an expansive and fragmented threat environment combine to produce an immense opportunity for baking bias into the loop. This paper presents the results of two experiments designed to explore different manifestations of AI systems in the cyber conflict decision-making loop. Though findings suggest that technical expertise positively impacts respondents’ ability to gauge the potential utility and credibility of an input (indicating that training can, in fact, overcome decision-maker bias), the perception of human agency in the loop even in the presence of AI inputs mitigates this cautionary effect and makes decision-makers more willing to operate on less overall information.},

    abstract = {The capabilities of Artificial Intelligence (AI) evolve rapidly and affect almost all sectors of society. AI has been increasingly integrated into criminal and harmful activities, expanding existing vulnerabilities, and introducing new threats. This article reviews the relevant literature, reports, and representative incidents which allows to construct a typology of the malicious use and abuse of systems with AI capabilities. The main objective is to clarify the types of activities and corresponding risks. Our starting point is to identify the vulnerabilities of AI models and outline how malicious actors can abuse them. Subsequently, we explore AI-enabled and AI-enhanced attacks. While we present a comprehensive overview, we do not aim for a conclusive and exhaustive classification. Rather, we provide an overview of the risks of enhanced AI application, that contributes to the growing body of knowledge on the issue. Specifically, we suggest four types of malicious abuse of AI (integrity attacks, unintended AI outcomes, algorithmic trading, membership inference attacks) and four types of malicious use of AI (social engineering, misinformation/fake news, hacking, autonomous weapon systems). Mapping these threats enables advanced reflection of governance strategies, policies, and activities that can be developed or improved to minimize risks and avoid harmful consequences. Enhanced collaboration among governments, industries, and civil society actors is vital to increase preparedness and resilience against malicious use and abuse of AI.},

Microgrids with the advantages of being flexible, environmentally friendly, and self-sufficient can improve the power system performance metrics such as resiliency and reliability. However, the design and implementation of microgrids are always faced with different challenges considering the uncertainties associated with loads and renewable energy resources, sudden load variations, energy management of several energy resources, etc. Therefore, it is required to employ such rapid and accurate methods, as artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, to address these challenges and improve the MG's efficiency, stability, security, and reliability. Utilization of AI helps to develop systems as intelligent as humans to learn, decide, and solve problems. This article presents a review on different applications of AI-based techniques in microgrids such as energy management, load and generation forecasting, protection, power electronics control, and cyber security. Different AI tasks such as regression and classification in microgrids are discussed using methods including machine learning, artificial neural networks, fuzzy logic, support vector machines, etc. The advantages, limitation, and future trends of AI applications in microgrids are discussed.},

They have a wide range of applications like :- image to image translation, improving the resolution of the images, creating multiple images using a single image, checking if the image is real or fake and the list goes on. One of the implementations of GANS, i.e, DCGANS would be discussed in this paper. DCGANS stands for Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks, it uses convolutional and convolutional-transpose layers in the generator and discriminator, respectively. This DCGANS give prompt result while processing many real time images. In their study Unsupervised representation Learning with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks, Radford et al. proposed it. This algorithm generates fake images after being trained on a dataset of human faces. However to create these fake images, the quality of these images should be compromised and this can also make them easily identifiable as fake image. So, here StyleGANS will be used as another implementation of GANS. StyleGANS is not only used for improving the quality of these images but also it helps us to increase fakeness of the images.

Some researchers have studied machine learning algorithms for categorizing earthquake vibrations. In this experiment, earthquake vibrations are categorized using the Artificial Neural Network method. We need appropriate datasets to obtain the maximum accuracy from the artificial neural network technique. The findings of this experiment show that feature extraction is required for the datasets to be trained to obtain a high accuracy value. The mean, median, maximum, minimum, skew, and kurtosis values are the feature that are extracted. In addition to employing feature extraction, it is crucial to modify the algorithm model. The experimental setup that uses “sigmoid” activation on the input layer, the three hidden layers, and the output layer yields the best accuracy when all feature are extracted, with training to test ratio of 90% to 10%. This is demonstrated by the exceptional training accuracy and testing accuracy values, which are 99.85 percent for training accuracy and 99.12 percent for validation accuracy. The mean value yields the highest accuracy result compared to employing just one feature extraction. Only 90.97 and 90.37 percent of training and validation accuracy are obtained when the mean is used alone for feature extraction.},

While progress has been made to better understand the trustworthiness and security of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, little has been done to translate this knowledge to education and training. There is a critical need to foster a qualified cybersecurity workforce that understands the usefulness, limitations, and best practices of AI technologies in the cybersecurity domain. To address this import issue, in our proposed learning paradigm, we leverage multidisciplinary expertise in cybersecurity, AI, and statistics to systematically investigate two cohesive research and education goals. First, we develop an immersive learning environment that motivates the students to explore AI/machine learning (ML) development in the context of real-world cybersecurity scenarios by constructing learning models with tangible objects. Second, we design a proactive education paradigm with the use of hackathon activities based on game-based learning, lifelong learning, and social constructivism. The proposed paradigm will benefit a wide range of learners, especially underrepresented students. It will also help the general public understand the security implications of AI. In this paper, we describe our proposed learning paradigm and present our current progress of this ongoing research work. In the current stage, we focus on the first research and education goal and have been leveraging cost-effective Minecraft platform to develop an immersive learning environment where the learners are able to investigate the insights of the emerging AI/ML concepts by constructing related learning modules via interacting with tangible AI/ML building blocks.},

Routine care data (laboratory results, medication orders, progress notes) and research-generated datasets now fuel state-of-the-art machine-learning (ML) pipelines that sharpen diagnosis, prognosis, antimicrobial stewardship, and, by combining both sources, accelerate drug discovery. In diagnostics, deep networks that now flag pneumonia or tuberculosis on chest images are increasingly able to identify—and localize—virtually more infectious processes throughout the body, while simultaneously predicting pathogen identity and antimicrobial resistance from routine microbiology. Prognostic models trained on Electronic Health Records surpass traditional scores in anticipating clinical deterioration or postoperative sepsis, enabling earlier targeted interventions. Predictive analytics can also personalize antimicrobial dosing by fusing real-time drug-monitoring data. Large language models (LLMs) build upon these advances by transforming unstructured clinical narratives into structured phenotypes suitable for predictive modeling, automatically summarizing patient encounters, generating synthetic cohorts for rare conditions, and providing real-time conversational decision support at the patient’s bedside. Despite rapid progress, real-world deployment faces hurdles: high computational and licensing costs, vendor-specific implementation constraints, limited cross-site model transferability, and fragmented governance of safety, bias, and cybersecurity risks. Rigorous, lifecycle-based evaluation frameworks—covering external validation, cost-effectiveness analysis, and post-deployment monitoring—are required to ensure safe, equitable, and sustainable AI adoption.

    abstract = {Introduction
Suicide remains a critical global public health issue, with approximately 800,000 deaths annually. Despite various prevention efforts, suicide rates are rising, highlighting the need for more effective strategies. Traditional suicide risk assessment methods often fall short in accuracy and predictive capability. This has driven interest in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly machine learning (ML), as a potential solution. This paper reviews systematic evaluations of AI's effectiveness in predicting suicide risk, aiming to explore AI's potential while addressing its challenges and limitations.
Methodology
A meta-research approach was used to review existing systematic reviews on AI's role in suicide risk prediction. Following PRISMA guidelines, a comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed and Web of Science for publications from 2004 to 2024. Relevant studies were selected based on specific inclusion criteria, and data were extracted on review characteristics, AI techniques, outcomes, and methodological quality. The review focuses on AI/ML models predicting suicidal ideation (SI), suicide attempts (SA), and suicide deaths (SD) separately, excluding non-suicidal self-injury.
Results
Out of 96 initial articles, 23 met the inclusion criteria for full-text review. Most studies focused on developing ML models to identify suicide risk, showing promising results in enhancing accuracy and effectiveness. These models utilize various data sources and analytical techniques. However, challenges remain, including high bias risk and issues with interpretability, which necessitate further validation and refinement of AI-driven methods.
Conclusion
The review underscores the significant potential of AI, especially ML, in predicting suicide risk and attempts. Although ML models show promise, challenges like data limitations, bias, and interpretability issues need addressing. Continued research and ethical scrutiny are crucial to fully realize AI's potential in suicide prevention.},

Innovations in deep neural networks (DNNs) and physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) now provide robust tools to tackle longstanding challenges in light scattering engineering, meta-optics, and nonlinear photonics. This review outlines recent progress in leveraging these computational methodologies to enhance device performance across domains such as dynamic light modulation, antenna design, and nonlinear optical phenomena. We systematically survey advancements in AI-driven forward and inverse design strategies, which bypass conventional trial-and-error approaches by embedding physical laws directly into optimization workflows. Furthermore, the integration of AI accelerates electromagnetic simulations and enables precise modelling of complex optical effects, including topological photonic states and nonlinear interactions. A comparative evaluation of algorithmic frameworks highlights their strengths in balancing computational efficiency, multi-objective optimization, and fabrication feasibility. Challenges such as limited interpretability of AI models and data scarcity for unconventional optical modes are critically addressed. Finally, we emphasize future opportunities in scalable multi-physics modelling, adaptive architectures, and practical deployment of AI-optimized photonic devices. This work underscores the pivotal role of AI in transcending traditional design limitations, thereby propelling the development of next-generation photonic technologies with unprecedented functionality and efficiency.},

    abstract = {Objective
To systematically review the utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) in health literacy, highlighting limitations and future developments.
Methods
A systematic review, following PRISMA guidelines, was conducted searching six databases for studies published from January 1, 2014, through April 10, 2024. Data extracted included: population characteristics, health literacy definitions and measurement, study objectives, AI techniques, metrics. Risk of bias was assessed using an adapted checklist.
Results
From 1296 studies, 18 met inclusion criteria. These studies primarily evaluated text-based materials, including online articles, and electronic health records, with most materials in English, but also incorporated other languages. AI played various roles, including evaluating complexity, text simplification/readability enhancement, translation, and question-answering. Only five studies involved participant engagement. Seven studies provided a health literacy definition, consistently describing it as an individual's ability to obtain, understand, and use health information for informed decisions, often linking it to external factors. However, only one study incorporated an individual-level health literacy measurement tool, while organizational-level health literacy measurement remained largely overlooked. The AI techniques used included traditional machine learning, deep learning, and transformer-based models. Evaluation metrics were categorized into human evaluation, readability and machine learning metrics.
Conclusion
The review highlights AI's dynamic application in relation to health literacy, however, measurement of health literacy, at both an individual and organizational level, to evidence AI's effectiveness remains limited. In addition, future work should not only measure health literacy outcomes more rigorously but also pursue research on enhancing AI model performance, robust evaluation and their practical implementation in real-world settings.},

    abstract = {Pavement damage detection is vital in ensuring road-users safety and reducing economic losses related to maintenance and road incidents, thus making it a highly discussed research topic. Non-destructive pavement damage inspection methods have been rigorously explored, compared and integrated in the road health and safety practices. In particular, 3D imaging stands out due to its ability to extract the depth and geometric characteristics of the detected defects, thus facilitating performing accurate maintenance and corrective actions. During the past few years, with the rise of the highly accurate and robust artificial intelligence-driven analysis, researchers have increasingly adopted machine learning and deep learning models in pavement damage assessment. This paper systematically and exhaustively reviews the use of artificial intelligence-based 3D automated damage detection of pavement performed using laser scanners, stereo cameras/structure from motion and infrared sensors. It compiled 85 contributions published between 2011 to mid-2024. From which, the adopted artificial intelligence models, utilized 3D data collection hardware, utilized datasets, 3D data pre-processing techniques and application domains were extracted, compared and critically analyzed. The survey ultimately highlights the gaps and potential future research directions. Key findings highlight the need to explore more cost-effective and advanced 3D data collection methods, such as drones, in addition to enhancing 3D data preprocessing techniques to boost AI performance. Furthermore, the lack of comprehensive open 3D datasets is a significant gap that, if addressed, could help standardize research. Moreover, the research highlights the need for expanding the use of AI models to cover a wider range of pavement deformities.},

    abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) has regained strong momentum in medicine, driven by unprecedented computing power and the availability of massive clinical datasets. Intensive care units (ICUs) are at the forefront of this movement, given their unique combination of high data density, decision-making under uncertainty, and the vulnerability of critically ill patients. Yet despite the abundance of proof-of-concept studies, the clinical translation of AI tools remains strikingly limited, with fewer than 2 % of published algorithms prospectively evaluated in real-world ICU settings. In this editorial, we discuss the roadmap proposed by Workum et al., which outlines a progressive, risk-aligned framework for the integration of AI in critical care. Beyond model performance, the authors emphasize fundamental values such as fairness, explainability, and accountability, while highlighting the practical challenges of data interoperability, infrastructure, governance, and liability. Their work reminds us that AI adoption is not primarily hindered by algorithms themselves but by the surrounding ecosystem of data quality, regulatory clarity, and clinician trust. We argue that the true promise of AI in the ICU lies not in rapid technological breakthroughs but in careful, evidence-based, and human-centered implementation. Whether these systems will ultimately improve patient-centered outcomes remains uncertain. The roadmap by Workum et al. should therefore be read as a call for cautious progress: to begin with low-risk applications, to invest in infrastructure and interdisciplinary collaboration, and to rigorously evaluate clinical benefit before moving toward high-stakes medical decision support.},

Overcrowding and long wait times in emergency departments (EDs) remain global challenges that negatively affect patient outcomes and staff satisfaction. As an emerging technology, artificial intelligence (AI) offers the potential to optimize ED operations and reduce wait times.
Objective
Establish a strategy to evaluate AI modeling as it relates to utilizing AI based strategies for ED flow.
Methods
We searched Embase, MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Scopus for English-language studies published from January 1, 1946, to August 17, 2023, and we will update our search to ensure currency. The ROBINS-I tool assessed study quality, while PROBAST examined the risk of bias and applicability.
Results
Out of 17,569 screened studies, 65 full-text articles were evaluated for eligibility, with 16 quantitative observational studies meeting inclusion criteria. The best-performing algorithms included regression-based methods (n = 2), traditional single-model machine learning (n = 8), neural networks/deep learning (n = 3), natural language processing (n = 1), and ensemble methods (n = 2). None of the studies examined AI’s impact in a real ED setting, though four simulations reported wait-time reductions ranging from 7 to 43.2 minutes.
Conclusions
AI integration in ED is still in its infancy. Our review found no real-world ED implementation studies, and most of the existing research lacked involvement from ED experts. This gap highlights the lack of insight into AI’s practical impact. Future reviews and research must clarify these dimensions, guiding AI's effective, collaborative adoption in ED workflows.},

    abstract = {Research question
Can generative AI models provide reliable counselling to fertility patients regarding real-world clinical questions.
Design
In this cross-sectional study, 12 clinical questions were developed to reflect common, real-life dilemmas encountered during fertility workup and treatment. Responses to each question were generated by two experienced fertility specialists, ChatGPT, and Gemini. Eight leading internationally recognized fertility experts, blinded to the source of each reply, independently rated all responses on a scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 10 (strongly agree). Ratings were compared across all four repliers using non-parametric statistical tests.
Results
Replies authored by physicians received significantly higher overall scores than those generated by AI models (p<0.001). Median scores were highest for Doctor A (9.0), followed by Doctor B (8.0), then ChatGPT (7.0), and finally Gemini received the lowest score (4.5). The proportion of high-scoring responses (≥8) was greatest for Doctor A (70.8%), followed by Doctor B (56.3%), then ChatGPT (47.9%), and finally Gemini (35.4%) (p<0.001).
Conclusion
Experienced fertility specialists outperformed generative AI models in providing accurate responses to complex clinical questions. Despite the growing accessibility and sophistication of AI tools, their use for individualized fertility counseling remains limited. Continued refinement and clinical validation of AI tools are essential before they can be considered reliable for patient-specific guidance. At present, AI should be viewed as a complementary resource rather than a substitute for expert clinical judgment.},

    abstract = {Introduction
Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming healthcare education; however, its integration into pharmacy curricula requires further exploration. This study aimed to explore the acceptance of AI-based technology in pharmacy education through the extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) framework and identify opportunities for responsible integration via improved AI literacy.
Methods
A qualitative study was conducted at the School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Ulster University, Northern Ireland, United Kingdom, in April 2025. Eight MPharm students were recruited through purposive sampling, with two participants from each of the four academic years (Years 1–4) to ensure representation of developmental perspectives. Informed by the extended UTAUT framework, semi-structured interviews were conducted via Microsoft Teams. Thematic analysis was conducted using Braun and Clarke's six-phase approach, with data management performed using NVivo 13.
Results
Four major themes emerged from the analysis: (1) Current Understanding and Experience with AI Tools, (2) Perceived Benefits and Opportunities, (3) Challenges and Concerns, and (4) Recommendations for Responsible AI Integration. Students demonstrated a developmental progression in AI use, from basic concept clarification in the first year to complex clinical reasoning applications in senior years. Students primarily discovered AI tools through informal networks rather than formal academic channels. Key benefits included immediate conceptual clarification across multidisciplinary subjects, enhanced academic efficiency, and support for clinical preparation through simulated patient interactions. However, concerns were expressed regarding regional context limitations, accuracy and reliability issues, potential impacts on critical thinking development, uncertainties related to academic integrity, and affordability constraints for premium features.
Conclusion
The findings reveal that students resourcefully use AI tools to enhance learning but navigate considerable challenges, including information inaccuracies, ethical uncertainties, and concerns about adverse impacts on critical thinking skills. Future recommendations include establishing clear institutional policies, implementing formal AI literacy training, developing UK-centric pharmacy-specific AI tools, and adopting scaffolded curriculum integration approaches.},

    abstract = {Background
Research on the diagnosis of COVID-19 using lung images is limited by the scarcity of imaging data. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are popular for synthesis and data augmentation. GANs have been explored for data augmentation to enhance the performance of artificial intelligence (AI) methods for the diagnosis of COVID-19 within lung computed tomography (CT) and X-ray images. However, the role of GANs in overcoming data scarcity for COVID-19 is not well understood.
Objective
This review presents a comprehensive study on the role of GANs in addressing the challenges related to COVID-19 data scarcity and diagnosis. It is the first review that summarizes different GAN methods and lung imaging data sets for COVID-19. It attempts to answer the questions related to applications of GANs, popular GAN architectures, frequently used image modalities, and the availability of source code.
Methods
A search was conducted on 5 databases, namely PubMed, IEEEXplore, Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Digital Library, Scopus, and Google Scholar. The search was conducted from October 11-13, 2021. The search was conducted using intervention keywords, such as “generative adversarial networks” and “GANs,” and application keywords, such as “COVID-19” and “coronavirus.” The review was performed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines for systematic and scoping reviews. Only those studies were included that reported GAN-based methods for analyzing chest X-ray images, chest CT images, and chest ultrasound images. Any studies that used deep learning methods but did not use GANs were excluded. No restrictions were imposed on the country of publication, study design, or outcomes. Only those studies that were in English and were published from 2020 to 2022 were included. No studies before 2020 were included.
Results
This review included 57 full-text studies that reported the use of GANs for different applications in COVID-19 lung imaging data. Most of the studies (n=42, 74%) used GANs for data augmentation to enhance the performance of AI techniques for COVID-19 diagnosis. Other popular applications of GANs were segmentation of lungs and superresolution of lung images. The cycleGAN and the conditional GAN were the most commonly used architectures, used in 9 studies each. In addition, 29 (51%) studies used chest X-ray images, while 21 (37%) studies used CT images for the training of GANs. For the majority of the studies (n=47, 82%), the experiments were conducted and results were reported using publicly available data. A secondary evaluation of the results by radiologists/clinicians was reported by only 2 (4%) studies.
Conclusions
Studies have shown that GANs have great potential to address the data scarcity challenge for lung images in COVID-19. Data synthesized with GANs have been helpful to improve the training of the convolutional neural network (CNN) models trained for the diagnosis of COVID-19. In addition, GANs have also contributed to enhancing the CNNs’ performance through the superresolution of the images and segmentation. This review also identified key limitations of the potential transformation of GAN-based methods in clinical applications.},

This study adopted a quantitative methodology for the data collection process applying a cross-sectional approach through testing deductive-hypotheses techniques. 263 valid surveys were used for analysis using hybrid analysis measurements (i.e., PLS-SEM, and CB-SEM). Further, it was applied data reliability, convergent validity, and discriminant validity tests. Additionally, examined the mediating effect of exploratory innovation (EXPI), and exploitative innovation (EXTI) on DSCP. The study findings assured that the proposed direct and indirect causal associations illustrated in the study model were accepted due to that all associations between the dimensions s were statistically significant. The findings of the GAIC supported a positive relationship between GAIC and the DSCP, GAIC on EXPI and EXTI, and EXPI and EXTI on DSCP respectively. Furthermore, the mediating effect of EXPI and EXTI is statistically significant, which was confirmed. This study developed a conceptual model to merge GAIC, AMI, and DSCP.

To identify potentially relevant studies, we conducted a literature search with keywords related to NAMs across three major topic areas: in silico, in chemico, and in vitro. We prioritized studies by coupling supervised clustering, topic extraction and keyword analysis algorithms. These methods led to the prioritization of 8,418 studies. To identify relevant studies, subject matter experts were employed in conjunction with active machine learning to identify relevant studies that were then summarized via GenAI. Given the objective was to provide sufficient coverage of the landscape to both address pragmatic, near-term needs, as well as shaping the future of how safety assessments are performed, we designed prompts to characterize the current and past systematic efforts directed towards developing and refining NAMs, including both success stories, scientific and technical challenges, and roadblocks to wider adoption. Our analysis identified 3,010 peer-reviewed publications and 38 consortium websites cataloguing NAMs that were applicable to the cosmetics regulatory process, from hazard-focused endpoints to exposure-based waiving of studies altogether. Additionally, they covered the full spectrum of maturity, from those approaches that show promise at the research and development phase to fully validated approaches ready for immediate regulatory use. To the extent available, we identified the molecular/cellular endpoints associated with each NAM and the reference dataset that was used to develop and/or evaluate usefulness and limitations across a total of 60,960 endpoints. The landscape also captured opportunities to validate mature NAMs to support their regulatory use and market adoption. These results will support the development and identification of NAMs to be included in frameworks for assessing systemic toxicity potential.},

    abstract = {In the field of medicine, uncertainty is inherent. Physicians are asked to make decisions on a daily basis without complete certainty, whether it is in understanding the patient’s problem, performing the physical examination, interpreting the findings of diagnostic tests, or proposing a management plan. The reasons for this uncertainty are widespread, including the lack of knowledge about the patient, individual physician limitations, and the limited predictive power of objective diagnostic tools. This uncertainty poses significant problems in providing competent patient care. Research efforts and teaching are attempts to reduce uncertainty that have now become inherent to medicine. Despite this, uncertainty is rampant. Artificial intelligence (AI) tools, which are being rapidly developed and integrated into practice, may change the way we navigate uncertainty. In their strongest forms, AI tools may have the ability to improve data collection on diseases, patient beliefs, values, and preferences, thereby allowing more time for physician-patient communication. By using methods not previously considered, these tools hold the potential to reduce the uncertainty in medicine, such as those arising due to the lack of clinical information and provider skill and bias. Despite this possibility, there has been considerable resistance to the implementation of AI tools in medical practice. In this viewpoint article, we discuss the impact of AI on medical uncertainty and discuss practical approaches to teaching the use of AI tools in medical schools and residency training programs, including AI ethics, real-world skills, and technological aptitude.},

However, its current research landscape remains fragmented, with limited synthesis of trends and unclear pathways for adoption in the construction industry. To address these gaps, a mixed-method review is conducted, combining bibliometric analysis to quantitatively map research trends with qualitative thematic synthesis for in-depth contextual insights. A total of 148 publications were retrieved from Scopus and Google Scholar (2014–2024). The bibliometric analysis identified 49 high-frequency keywords, grouped into six thematic clusters, characterizing the quantitative research landscape. Complementing this, the qualitative synthesis examined five dominant application domains: (1) proactive safety monitoring and risk prevention, (2) generative AI for sustainable construction, (3) automating design through generative intelligence, (4) construction education, and (5) construction management, within which key research gaps and practical challenges are critically examined. Building upon these insights, the study proposes four-level research roadmap spanning (1) industry-level considerations, (2) organizational and stakeholder perspectives, (3) project-level perspectives, and (4) technological integration. Unlike prior reviews that concentrated on isolated single-model technologies or narrowly defined domains, this study offers a comprehensive, cross-domain analysis of generative AI for construction. By employing a mixed-method review—integrating quantitative bibliometric mapping and qualitative thematic synthesis—it bridges technical, organizational, and implementation perspectives to deliver a holistic understanding of the field. Hence, this review offers clear avenues for future investigation, empowering researchers to expand and refine Generative AI toward achieving a more efficient, resilient, and sustainable construction.},

    abstract = {Aims
To investigate the prognostic accuracy of a non-medical generative artificial intelligence model (Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer 4 - ChatGPT-4) as a novel aspect in predicting death and poor neurological outcome at hospital discharge based on real-life data from cardiac arrest patients.
Methods
This prospective cohort study investigates the prognostic performance of ChatGPT-4 to predict outcomes at hospital discharge of adult cardiac arrest patients admitted to intensive care at a large Swiss tertiary academic medical center (COMMUNICATE/PROPHETIC cohort study). We prompted ChatGPT-4 with sixteen prognostic parameters derived from established post-cardiac arrest scores for each patient. We compared the prognostic performance of ChatGPT-4 regarding the area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and likelihood ratios of three cardiac arrest scores (Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest [OHCA], Cardiac Arrest Hospital Prognosis [CAHP], and PROgnostication using LOGistic regression model for Unselected adult cardiac arrest patients in the Early stages [PROLOGUE score]) for in-hospital mortality and poor neurological outcome.
Results
Mortality at hospital discharge was 43% (n = 309/713), 54% of patients (n = 387/713) had a poor neurological outcome. ChatGPT-4 showed good discrimination regarding in-hospital mortality with an AUC of 0.85, similar to the OHCA, CAHP, and PROLOGUE (AUCs of 0.82, 0.83, and 0.84, respectively) scores. For poor neurological outcome, ChatGPT-4 showed a similar prediction to the post-cardiac arrest scores (AUC 0.83).
Conclusions
ChatGPT-4 showed a similar performance in predicting mortality and poor neurological outcome compared to validated post-cardiac arrest scores. However, more research is needed regarding illogical answers for potential incorporation of an LLM in the multimodal outcome prognostication after cardiac arrest.},

Conducted through a survey sent to all Danish researchers from January to February 2024, the study received 2534 responses and evaluated 32 GenAI use cases across five research phases: idea generation, research design, data collection, data analysis, and writing/reporting. Respondents reported on their own and colleagues' GenAI usage. They also assessed whether the practices in the use cases were considered good research practice. Through an explorative factor analysis, we identified three clusters of perception: "GenAI as a work horse", "GenAI as a language assistant only", and "GenAI as a research accelerator". The findings further show varied opinions on GenAI's research integrity implications. Language editing and data analysis were generally viewed positively, whereas experiment design and peer review tasks faced more criticism. Controversial areas included image creation/modification and synthetic data, with comments highlighting the need for critical and reflexive use of GenAI. Usage differed by main research area, with technical and quantitative sciences reporting slightly higher usage and more positive assessments. Junior researchers used GenAI more than senior colleagues, while no significant gender differences were observed.

Grounded in Allport's (1954) Contact Hypothesis and the Dual Identity Model (DIM; Gaertner & Dovidio, 2000), the study examines whether structured interactions with artificial humans can foster positive intergroup attitudes. Following the framework of E-contact interventions (White & Abu-Rayya, 2012), participants (N = 70 Caucasian university students) will engage in a within-between mixed-design experiment over three days. They will interact daily with an AI-powered 3D digital assistant representing either an outgroup member (Black avatar) or an ingroup member (White avatar) depending on the experimental condition, with pre- and post-intervention measures of intergroup attitudes. The structured interactions will follow the two-phase design of E-contact interventions, initially fostering personal acquaintance, then emphasizing group salience, and finally reinforcing a shared superordinate identity—a process aligned with the principles of DIM to maximize the generalization of positive intergroup attitudes. The virtual assistant will facilitate cooperative activities designed to enhance inclusivity, promote cultural exchange, and maintain subgroup distinctiveness while fostering a common identity. To ensure the effectiveness and coherence of the intervention, the scripted interactions will be pretested through a pilot study before implementation. This research offers a preliminary step toward understanding how artificial intelligence might contribute to enhancing E-contact interventions, potentially providing scalable and structured tools for fostering positive intergroup relations and supporting social integration.},

    abstract = {Background and Objectives
AI has emerged as a transformative force in clinical medicine, changing the diagnosis, treatment, and management of patients. Tools have been derived for working with ML, DL, and NLP algorithms to analyze large complex medical datasets with unprecedented accuracy and speed, thereby improving diagnostic precision, treatment personalization, and patient care outcomes. For example, CNNs have dramatically improved the accuracy of medical imaging diagnoses, and NLP algorithms have greatly helped extract insights from unstructured data, including EHRs. However, there are still numerous challenges that face AI integration into clinical workflows, including data privacy, algorithmic bias, ethical dilemmas, and problems with the interpretability of “black-box” AI models. These barriers have thus far prevented the widespread application of AI in health care, and its possible trends, obstacles, and future implications are necessary to be systematically explored. The purpose of this paper is, therefore, to assess the current trends in AI applications in clinical medicine, identify those obstacles that are hindering adoption, and identify possible future directions. This research hopes to synthesize evidence from other peer-reviewed articles to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the role that AI plays to advance clinical practices, improve patient outcomes, or enhance decision-making.
Methods
A systematic review was done according to the PRISMA guidelines to explore the integration of Artificial Intelligence in clinical medicine, including trends, challenges, and future directions. PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Scopus databases were searched for peer-reviewed articles from 2014 to 2024 with keywords such as “Artificial Intelligence in Medicine,” “AI in Clinical Practice,” “Machine Learning in Healthcare,” and “Ethical Implications of AI in Medicine.” Studies focusing on AI application in diagnostics, treatment planning, and patient care reporting measurable clinical outcomes were included. Non-clinical AI applications and articles published before 2014 were excluded. Selected studies were screened for relevance, and then their quality was critically appraised to synthesize data reliably and rigorously.
Results
This systematic review includes the findings of 8 studies that pointed out the transformational role of AI in clinical medicine. AI tools, such as CNNs, had diagnostic accuracy more than the traditional methods, particularly in radiology and pathology. Predictive models efficiently supported risk stratification, early disease detection, and personalized medicine. Despite these improvements, significant hurdles, including data privacy, algorithmic bias, and resistance from clinicians regarding the “black-box” nature of AI, had yet to be surmounted. XAI has emerged as an attractive solution that offers the promise to enhance interpretability and trust. As a whole, AI appeared promising in enhancing diagnostics, treatment personalization, and clinical workflows by dealing with systemic inefficiencies.
Conclusion
The transformation potential of AI in clinical medicine can transform diagnostics, treatment strategies, and efficiency. Overcoming obstacles such as concerns about data privacy, the danger of algorithmic bias, and difficulties with interpretability may pave the way for broader use and facilitate improvement in patient outcomes while transforming clinical workflows to bring sustainability into healthcare delivery.},

During this transformation, it can be difficult to understand how AI will change the way work is done. This study explores how generative AI could change manufacturing work. Data collection was conducted using interviews and a questionnaire with seven representatives from three industrial companies. They identified several application areas for GenAI in the industrial work context, such as design, planning, training, problem solving, coding and data management. They also expressed positive attitudes but raised concerns about trust, safety, acceptability and interoperability. Changes in work were identified as being more related to cognitive aspects such as changing the way of thinking and altering the interaction with people and machines. Therefore, human-AI design efforts should focus especially on cognitive ergonomics. Findings from this study can be used in the manufacturing industry when adopting AI, as well as in identifying research topics in the human-AI research community.},

AI enhances prediction and early detection capabilities, but introduces concerns including the “black box” nature of many algorithms, which compromises transparency and may propagate existing biases. Justice considerations arise from potential inequities in AI development and deployment. Autonomy is challenged when clinicians cannot fully explain algorithmic decision-making, affecting shared decision-making with families. These ethical tensions are particularly acute in neonatology, where decisions impact vulnerable patients who cannot advocate for themselves. Mitigating these challenges requires developing transparent AI systems, ensuring diverse training data, maintaining human oversight of clinical decisions, and conducting rigorous validation across diverse healthcare settings. Responsible implementation requires balancing technological benefits with ethical principles.},

As a result of searching Web of Science (WoS), Scopus, Education Resources Information Center (ERIC), and EBSCO databases in accordance with the criteria determined, 15 studies were included in the analysis. As a result of the descriptive analysis, five main themes were identified: critical content production and evaluation, metacognitive skills and self-regulation, ethical thinking and evaluation, analytical thinking and problem solving, motivation and self-efficacy for the AI-assisted writing process and critical literacy skills. Our findings show that students use AI tools not as a simple copy-paste tool, but as a supportive element to develop their thinking. Students question AI outputs, synthesize them with their own ideas and manage their writing processes more consciously. The findings of our study reveal that AI-assisted writing experiences increase students' ethical awareness of originality, academic honesty and creativity, improve their systematic thinking skills in complex writing tasks, and increase their motivation to write. However, the lack of any study at preschool level, the limited number of studies at primary school level, and the scarcity of qualitative studies indicate that more research is needed in this field.},

    abstract = {Background
The online pharmacy market is growing, with legitimate online pharmacies offering advantages such as convenience and accessibility. However, this increased demand has attracted malicious actors into this space, leading to the proliferation of illegal vendors that use deceptive techniques to rank higher in search results and pose serious public health risks by dispensing substandard or falsified medicines. Search engine providers have started integrating generative artificial intelligence (AI) into search engine interfaces, which could revolutionize search by delivering more personalized results through a user-friendly experience. However, improper integration of these new technologies carries potential risks and could further exacerbate the risks posed by illicit online pharmacies by inadvertently directing users to illegal vendors.
Objective
The role of generative AI integration in reshaping search engine results, particularly related to online pharmacies, has not yet been studied. Our objective was to identify, determine the prevalence of, and characterize illegal online pharmacy recommendations within the AI-generated search results and recommendations.
Methods
We conducted a comparative assessment of AI-generated recommendations from Google’s Search Generative Experience (SGE) and Microsoft Bing’s Chat, focusing on popular and well-known medicines representing multiple therapeutic categories including controlled substances. Websites were individually examined to determine legitimacy, and known illegal vendors were identified by cross-referencing with the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy and LegitScript databases.
Results
Of the 262 websites recommended in the AI-generated search results, 47.33% (124/262) belonged to active online pharmacies, with 31.29% (82/262) leading to legitimate ones. However, 19.04% (24/126) of Bing Chat’s and 13.23% (18/136) of Google SGE’s recommendations directed users to illegal vendors, including for controlled substances. The proportion of illegal pharmacies varied by drug and search engine. A significant difference was observed in the distribution of illegal websites between search engines. The prevalence of links leading to illegal online pharmacies selling prescription medications was significantly higher (P=.001) in Bing Chat (21/86, 24%) compared to Google SGE (6/92, 6%). Regarding the suggestions for controlled substances, suggestions generated by Google led to a significantly higher number of rogue sellers (12/44, 27%; P=.02) compared to Bing (3/40, 7%).
Conclusions
While the integration of generative AI into search engines offers promising potential, it also poses significant risks. This is the first study to shed light on the vulnerabilities within these platforms while highlighting the potential public health implications associated with their inadvertent promotion of illegal pharmacies. We found a concerning proportion of AI-generated recommendations that led to illegal online pharmacies, which could not only potentially increase their traffic but also further exacerbate existing public health risks. Rigorous oversight and proper safeguards are urgently needed in generative search to mitigate consumer risks, making sure to actively guide users to verified pharmacies and prioritize legitimate sources while excluding illegal vendors from recommendations.},

    abstract = {ABSTRACT
Background
Chronic urticaria (CU) severely impairs patients’ quality of life. Correctly diagnosing and treating CU can take years, meaning patients seek answers from the Internet to manage their condition.
Objective
We aimed to build a chatbot, AIDUS (Artificial Intelligence-Driven Urticaria Support), for patients with CU and treating physicians and evaluate its reliability in providing high-quality CU-specific information compared with Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (ChatGPT)-3.5 and ChatGPT-4o.
Methods
AIDUS was developed by an expert committee of urticaria and artificial intelligence specialists using JavaScript and OpenAI’s ChatGPT large language model. PubMed was systematically reviewed to ensure AIDUS contained high-quality information. The chatbot was populated exclusively with selected peer-reviewed CU publications authored by the Charité University, Berlin research group, published after 2014. Two hundred and fifty-four publications were integrated using ChatGPT-3.5 as the underlying algorithm. A set of 100 validated questions was developed based on current CU knowledge to evaluate the performance of AIDUS. The program was run on the same questions several times and compared for consistency. Performance was tested with different chunk- and overlap-size settings to optimize AIDUS’s efficiency and accuracy.
Results
AIDUS outperformed general ChatGPT models in terms of accuracy, consistency, and stability in answering CU-specific questions. AIDUS demonstrated higher average accuracy (94.6%) across multiple test runs compared with ChatGPT-3.5 (42.6%) and ChatGPT-4o (85.7%).
Conclusion
AIDUS provides reliable, high-quality information about CU, addressing patients’ and physicians’ needs for accurate, relevant answers based on peer-reviewed medical literature. AIDUS remains a means of assistance and does not replace consultation with a physician.},

This concept merges servitization —integrating services with products— and digitization —enhancing operations through digital technologies. While previous research has examined digital servitization and smart technologies, a gap remains in understanding how Artificial Intelligence (AI) specifically supports various types of digital servitization across both back-office and front-office activities. This study addresses this gap by investigating how AI enhances digital servitization through six case studies of companies implementing AI-driven servitized solutions. Adopting a capability theoretical perspective, we analyze the application of AI in both back-office and front-office activities for the delivery of base, intermediate, and advanced services. Our findings reveal that AI's role varies by service type, affecting customer interactions and operational tasks differently. We present a theoretical framework with five propositions that elucidate how AI capabilities enhance digital servitization. This framework gives scholars a refined understanding of AI's roles beyond the generalized black box approach and offers practitioners practical insights on leveraging AI for digital transformation.},

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a leading cause of dementia worldwide, characterized by heterogeneous neuropathological changes and progressive cognitive decline. Despite the numerous studies, there are still no effective treatments beyond those that aim to slow progression and compensate the impairment. Neuroimaging techniques provide a comprehensive view of brain changes, with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) playing a key role due to its non-invasive nature and wide availability. The T1-weighted MRI sequence is frequently used due to its prevalence in most MRI protocols, generating large datasets, ideal for artificial intelligence (AI) applications. AI, particularly machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques, has been increasingly utilized to model these datasets and classify individuals along the AD continuum. This systematic review evaluates studies using AI to classify more than two stages of AD based on T1-weighted MRI data. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are the most widely applied, achieving an average classification accuracy of 85.93 % (range: 51.80–100 %; median: 87.70 %). These good results are due to CNNs' ability to extract hierarchical features directly from raw imaging data, reducing the need for extensive preprocessing. Non-convolutional neural networks and traditional ML approaches also demonstrated strong performance, with mean accuracies of 82.50 % (range: 57.61–99.38 %; median: 86.67 %) and 84.22 % (range: 33–99.10 %; median: 87.75 %), respectively, underscoring importance of input data selection. Despite promising outcomes, challenges remain, including methodological heterogeneity, overfitting risks, and a reliance on the ADNI database, which limits dataset diversity. Addressing these limitations is critical to advancing AI's clinical application for early detection, improved classification, and enhanced patient outcomes.},

@article{BEALE2025100553,
    abstract = {BACKGROUND
Within public online forums, patients often seek reassurance and guidance from the community regarding postoperative symptoms and expectations, and when to seek medical assistance. Others are using artificial intelligence in the form of online search engines or chatbots such as ChatGPT or Perplexity. Artificial intelligence chatbot assistants have been growing in popularity; however, clinicians may be hesitant to use them because of concerns about accuracy. The online networking service for medical professionals, Doximity, has expanded its resources to include a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act–compliant artificial intelligence writing assistant, Doximity GPT, designed to reduce the administrative burden on clinicians. Health professionals learn using a “medical model,” which greatly differs from the “health belief model” that laypeople learn through. This mismatch in learning perspectives likely contributes to a communication mismatch even during digital clinician–patient encounters, especially in patients with limited health literacy during the perioperative period when complications may arise.
OBJECTIVE
This study aimed to evaluate the ability of artificial intelligence chatbot assistants (Doximity GPT, Perplexity, and ChatGPT) to generate quality, accurate, and empathetic responses to postoperative patient queries that are also understandable and actionable.
STUDY DESIGN
Responses to 10 postoperative queries sourced from HysterSisters, a public forum for “woman-to-woman hysterectomy support,” were generated using 3 artificial intelligence chatbot assistants (Doximity GPT, Perplexity, and ChatGPT) and a minimally invasive gynecologic surgery fellowship–trained surgeon. Ten physician evaluators compared the blinded responses for quality, accuracy, and empathy. A separate pair of physician evaluators scored the responses for understandability and actionability using the Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool for Printable Materials (PEMAT-P). The final scores were the average of both reviewers’ scores. Analysis of variance was used for pairwise comparison of the evaluator scores between sources. Lastly, the Kruskal–Wallis test was used to analyze Flesch–Kincaid scoring for readability. The Pearson chi-square test was used to demonstrate the difference in reading level among the responses for each source.
RESULTS
Compared with a physician, Doximity GPT and ChatGPT were rated as more empathetic than a minimally invasive gynecologic surgeon, but quality and accuracy were similar across these sources. There was a significant difference between Perplexity and the other response sources, favoring the latter, for quality and accuracy (P<.001). Perplexity and the minimally invasive gynecologic surgeon ranked similarly for empathy. Reading ease was greater for the minimally invasive gynecologic surgeon responses (60.6 [53.5–68.4]; eighth and ninth grade) than for Perplexity (40.0 [28.6–47.2], college) and ChatGPT (35.5 [28.2–42.0], college) (P<.01). There was no significant difference in understandability and actionability, with all sources scored as having good understandability and average actionability.
CONCLUSION
As artificial intelligence chatbot assistants grow in popularity, including integration in the electronic health record, the output’s readability must reflect the general population’s health literacy to be impactful and effective. This analysis serves as a reminder for physicians to be mindful of this mismatch in readability and general health literacy when considering the integration of artificial intelligence chatbot assistants into patient care. The accuracy and consistency of these chatbots may also impact patient outcomes, making screening of utmost importance in this endeavor.},

Despite therapeutic advances, delayed diagnosis and imprecise risk stratification remain key challenges. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) offer opportunities across the care continuum. This includes early detection from electronic health records, electrocardiography and imaging, automated, standardized interpretation of echocardiography, computed tomography (CT), and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) potentially expediting referral and final diagnosis. Deep learning applied to echocardiography achieves expert-level PAH classification and provides automated right-heart quantification while CT/CMR-based models segment the heart and great vessels, quantify lung disease radiomics, and infer hemodynamics, supporting noninvasive triage and prognostication. In future, remote monitoring with wearables and telemedicine, coupled with AI analytics, promises to enable proactive management and potentially reduce hospitalizations. While early studies are promising, translation to practice requires rigorous external validation, prospective studies, bias auditing and seamless integration into guideline-aligned workflows. Overall, AI stands to augment expert clinical judgement by converting high-dimensional, multimodal data into actionable insights. With careful governance and evidence generation, AI has the potential to shorten time-to-diagnosis, refine risk stratification, and personalize therapy in PAH, ultimately improving outcomes for this high-risk population.},

    abstract = {Capturing the time evolution and predicting kinetic sequences of states of physicochemical systems present significant challenges due to the precision and computational effort required. In this study, we demonstrate that ‘Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT)’, an artificial intelligence model renowned for machine translation and natural language processing, can be effectively adapted to predict the dynamical state-to-state transition kinetics of biologically relevant physicochemical systems. Specifically, by using sequences of time-discretized states from Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories akin to the vocabulary corpus of a language, we show that a GPT-based model can learn the complex syntactic and semantic relationships within the trajectory. This enables GPT to predict kinetically accurate sequences of states for a diverse set of biomolecules of varying complexity, at a much quicker pace than traditional MD simulations and with a better efficiency than other baseline time-series prediction approaches. More significantly, the approach is found to be equally adept at forecasting the time evolution of out-of-equilibrium active systems that do not maintain detailed balance. An analysis of the mechanism inherent in GPT reveals the crucial role of the ‘self-attention mechanism’ in capturing the long-range correlations necessary for accurate state-to-state transition predictions. Together, our results highlight generative artificial intelligence's ability to generate kinetic sequences of states of physicochemical systems with statistical precision.},

However, the advent of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) like GPT-4 Vision, capable of processing multimodal data including text, sound, and visual inputs, opens a new era of enriched, personalized, and interactive learning landscapes in education. This paper derives a theoretical framework for integrating MLLMs into multimodal learning. This framework serves to explore the transformative role of MLLMs in central aspects of science education by presenting exemplary innovative learning scenarios. Possible applications for MLLMs range from content creation to tailored support for learning, fostering engagement in scientific practices, and providing assessments and feedback. These applications are not limited to text-based and uni-modal formats but can be multimodal, thus increasing personalization, accessibility, and potential learning effectiveness. Despite the many opportunities, challenges such as data protection and ethical considerations become salient, calling for robust frameworks to ensure responsible integration. This paper underscores the necessity for a balanced approach in implementing MLLMs, where the technology complements rather than supplants the educators' roles, ensuring an effective and ethical use of AI in science education. It calls for further research to explore the nuanced implications of MLLMs for educators and to extend the discourse beyond science education to other disciplines. Through developing a theoretical framework for the integration of MLLMs into multimodal learning and exploring the associated potentials, challenges, and future implications, this paper contributes to a preliminary examination of the transformative role of MLLMs in science education and beyond.},

    abstract = {Background
The potential application of cutting-edge generative artificial intelligence chatbots in the capacity of emergency consultants is gaining growing attention. This study aimed to analyse the quality of advice on first aid for seizures generated by a commercially developed chatbot in comparison with its customised version.
Methods
The baseline version of ChatGPT (model GPT-4o) and the same chatbot customised using a specialised knowledge base and prompt engineering were tested in four scenarios mimicking bystander requests for instructions on how to help a victim with seizures. The scenarios included ongoing seizures and postictal states, with or without consciousness and breathing. A checklist-based evaluation was conducted.
Results
In total, 120 user-to-chatbot dialogues were generated (2 chatbots × 15 dialogues × 4 scenarios). The baseline chatbot always failed to consider the victim’s state, including whether the seizures are continuing, or if the victim in the postictal period is conscious and breathing normally. Its advice was non-selective and inaccurate, with frequent omissions of key recommendations on first aid and suggestions of inadequate measures. The customised chatbot-generated guidance was consistently tailored to the victim’s condition, significantly more precise and completely safe. Depending on the scenario, the mean percentage of chatbot responses that fulfilled the checklist items was 14–49 % for the baseline chatbot and 77–92 % for the customised version (p ≤ 0.039).
Conclusions
Whereas the publicly available version of the chatbot is not acceptable for first aid counselling, its expert-informed customisation ensures high accuracy and safety of generated advice. Further research in this field is advisable.},

The potential for generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) to assist with clinical tasks is the subject of ongoing debate within biomedical informatics and related fields.
Objective
This study aimed to explore general practitioners’ (GPs’) opinions about GenAI on primary care.
Methods
In January 2025, we conducted a web-based survey of 1005 UK GPs’ experiences and opinions of GenAI in clinical practice. This study involved a qualitative inductive descriptive analysis of a written response (“comments”) to an open-ended question in the survey. After analysis, the interpretation of themes was also informed by the technology acceptance model.
Results
Out of 1005 respondents, 611 GPs (61%) provided written comments in response to the free text question, totaling 7990 words. Comments were classified into 3 major themes and 8 subthemes in relation to GenAI in clinical practice. The major themes were (1) unfamiliarity, (2) ambivalence and anxiety, and (3) role in clinical tasks. “Unfamiliarity” encompassed a lack of experience and knowledge, and the need for training on GenAI. “Ambivalence and anxiety” included mixed expectations among GPs in relation to these tools, beliefs about diminished human connection, and skepticism about AI accountability. Finally, commenting on the role of GenAI in clinical tasks, GPs believed it would help with documentation. However, respondents questioned AI’s clinical judgment and raised concerns about operational uncertainty concerning these tools. Female GPs were more likely to leave comments than male GPs, with 53% (324/611) of female GPs providing feedback compared to 41.1% (162/394) who did not. Chi-square tests confirmed this difference ((χ²₂= 14.6, P=.001). In addition, doctors who left comments were significantly more likely to have used GenAI in clinical practice compared with those who did not. Among all respondents, 71.7% (438/611) had not used GenAI. However, noncommenters were even less likely to have used it, with 80.7% (318/394) reporting no use. A chi-square test confirmed this difference (χ²₁=10.0, P=.002).
Conclusions
This study provides timely insights into UK GPs’ perspectives on the role, impact, and limitations of GenAI in primary care. However, the study has limitations. The qualitative data analyzed originates from a self-selected subset of respondents who chose to provide free-text comments, and these participants were more likely to have used GenAI tools in clinical practice. However, the substantial number of comments offers valuable insights into the diverse views held by GPs regarding GenAI. Furthermore, the majority of our respondents reported limited experience and training with these tools; however, many GPs perceived potential benefits of GenAI and ambient AI for documentation. Notably, 2 years after the widespread introduction of GenAI, GPs’ persistent lack of understanding and training remains a critical concern. More extensive qualitative work would provide a more in-depth understanding of GPs’ views.},

    abstract = {Background
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 85 % of all lung cancer cases and remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI), artificial neural networks (ANNs), and machine learning (ML) into NSCLC management has shown potential in improving diagnostic accuracy, treatment personalization, and patient outcomes. However, the impact of these technologies on patient-reported outcome measures (PROM), overall survival (OS), and cost-effectiveness remains underexplored. This systematic review aims to evaluate the impact of AI, ANNs, and ML models on PROM, OS, and cost-effectiveness in adult patients with histologically confirmed NSCLC compared to conventional research methodologies and standard-of-care approaches.
Methods
A systematic review was conducted following the PRISMA guidelines, with data synthesized using the Synthesis Without Meta-analysis (SWiM) approach. Data extraction focused on study design, patient characteristics, AI methodology, and outcomes of interest. Given the heterogeneity in study designs and statistical methods, a meta-analysis was deemed inappropriate.
Results
Ten studies were included after screening 509 articles. AI-based models demonstrated improvements in diagnostic precision, treatment optimization, and predictive accuracy for survival outcomes. AI-enhanced approaches outperformed conventional statistical models in prognosis prediction and resource allocation. However, data heterogeneity, model generalizability, and algorithmic transparency remain significant challenges.
Conclusion
Current evidence supports exploratory associations between AI models and prognostic stratification for OS; there is no evaluable evidence on PROM or cost‑effectiveness in NSCLC. Future prospective studies should incorporate validated PROM and formal economic evaluation alongside clinical endpoints. AI, ANNs, and ML have the potential to revolutionize NSCLC care by improving diagnostic accuracy and treatment outcomes. However, further research is needed to validate their real-world clinical applicability and address potential biases, ethical implications, and concerns regarding healthcare disparities.},

@article{BOSCO2025,
    abstract = {Background
Many members of Black American communities, faced with the high prevalence of Alzheimer disease and related dementias (ADRD) within their demographic, find themselves taking on the role of informal caregivers. Despite being the primary individuals responsible for the care of individuals with ADRD, these caregivers often lack sufficient knowledge about ADRD-related health literacy and feel ill-prepared for their caregiving responsibilities. Generative AI has become a new promising technological innovation in the health care domain, particularly for improving health literacy; however, some generative AI developments might lead to increased bias and potential harm toward Black American communities. Therefore, rigorous development of generative AI tools to support the Black American community is needed.
Objective
The goal of this study is to test Lola, a multimodal mobile app, which, by relying on generative AI, facilitates access to ADRD-related health information by enabling speech and text as inputs and providing auditory, textual, and visual outputs.
Methods
To test our mobile app, we used the cognitive walk-through methodology, and we recruited 15 informal ADRD caregivers who were older than 50 years and part of the Black American community living within the region. We asked them to perform 3 tasks on the mobile app (ie, searching for an article on brain health, searching for local events, and finally, searching for opportunities to participate in scientific research in their area), then we recorded their opinions and impressions. The main aspects to be evaluated were the mobile app’s usability, accessibility, cultural relevance, and adoption.
Results
Our findings highlight the users’ need for a system that enables interaction with different modalities, the need for a system that can provide personalized and culturally and contextually relevant information, and the role of community and physical spaces in increasing the use of Lola.
Conclusions
Our study shows that, when designing for Black American older adults, a multimodal interaction with the generative AI system can allow individuals to choose their own interaction way and style based upon their interaction preferences and external constraints. This flexibility of interaction modes can guarantee an inclusive and engaging generative AI experience.},

Despite recent significant strides toward acceptance, inclusion, and equality, members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) community still face alarming mental health disparities, being almost 3 times more likely to experience depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts than their heterosexual counterparts. These unique psychological challenges are due to discrimination, stigmatization, and identity-related struggles and can potentially benefit from generative conversational artificial intelligence (AI). As the latest advancement in AI, conversational agents and chatbots can imitate human conversation and support mental health, fostering diversity and inclusivity, combating stigma, and countering discrimination. In contrast, if not properly designed, they can perpetuate exclusion and inequities.
Objective
This study aims to examine the impact of generative conversational AI on the LGBTQ community.
Methods
This study was designed as a scoping review. Four electronic scholarly databases (Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, and MEDLINE via PubMed) and gray literature (Google Scholar) were consulted from inception without any language restrictions. Original studies focusing on the LGBTQ community or counselors working with this community exposed to chatbots and AI-enhanced internet-based platforms and exploring the feasibility, acceptance, or effectiveness of AI-enhanced tools were deemed eligible. The findings were reported in accordance with the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews).
Results
Seven applications (HIVST-Chatbot, TelePrEP Navigator, Amanda Selfie, Crisis Contact Simulator, REALbot, Tough Talks, and Queer AI) were included and reviewed. The chatbots and internet-based assistants identified served various purposes: (1) to identify LGBTQ individuals at risk of suicide or contracting HIV or other sexually transmitted infections, (2) to provide resources to LGBTQ youth from underserved areas, (3) facilitate HIV status disclosure to sex partners, and (4) develop training role-play personas encompassing the diverse experiences and intersecting identities of LGBTQ youth to educate counselors. The use of generative conversational AI for the LGBTQ community is still in its early stages. Initial studies have found that deploying chatbots is feasible and well received, with high ratings for usability and user satisfaction. However, there is room for improvement in terms of the content provided and making conversations more engaging and interactive. Many of these studies used small sample sizes and short-term interventions measuring limited outcomes.
Conclusions
Generative conversational AI holds promise, but further development and formal evaluation are needed, including studies with larger samples, longer interventions, and randomized trials to compare different content, delivery methods, and dissemination platforms. In addition, a focus on engagement with behavioral objectives is essential to advance this field. The findings have broad practical implications, highlighting that AI’s impact spans various aspects of people’s lives. Assessing AI’s impact on diverse communities and adopting diversity-aware and intersectional approaches can help shape AI’s positive impact on society as a whole.},

    abstract = {Background
Adequate sleep is essential for maintaining individual and public health, positively affecting cognition and well-being, and reducing chronic disease risks. It plays a significant role in driving the economy, public safety, and managing health care costs. Digital tools, including websites, sleep trackers, and apps, are key in promoting sleep health education. Conversational artificial intelligence (AI) such as ChatGPT (OpenAI, Microsoft Corp) offers accessible, personalized advice on sleep health but raises concerns about potential misinformation. This underscores the importance of ensuring that AI-driven sleep health information is accurate, given its significant impact on individual and public health, and the spread of sleep-related myths.
Objective
This study aims to examine ChatGPT’s capability to debunk sleep-related disbeliefs.
Methods
A mixed methods design was leveraged. ChatGPT categorized 20 sleep-related myths identified by 10 sleep experts and rated them in terms of falseness and public health significance, on a 5-point Likert scale. Sensitivity, positive predictive value, and interrater agreement were also calculated. A qualitative comparative analysis was also conducted.
Results
ChatGPT labeled a significant portion (n=17, 85%) of the statements as “false” (n=9, 45%) or “generally false” (n=8, 40%), with varying accuracy across different domains. For instance, it correctly identified most myths about “sleep timing,” “sleep duration,” and “behaviors during sleep,” while it had varying degrees of success with other categories such as “pre-sleep behaviors” and “brain function and sleep.” ChatGPT’s assessment of the degree of falseness and public health significance, on the 5-point Likert scale, revealed an average score of 3.45 (SD 0.87) and 3.15 (SD 0.99), respectively, indicating a good level of accuracy in identifying the falseness of statements and a good understanding of their impact on public health. The AI-based tool showed a sensitivity of 85% and a positive predictive value of 100%. Overall, this indicates that when ChatGPT labels a statement as false, it is highly reliable, but it may miss identifying some false statements. When comparing with expert ratings, high intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) between ChatGPT’s appraisals and expert opinions could be found, suggesting that the AI’s ratings were generally aligned with expert views on falseness (ICC=.83, P<.001) and public health significance (ICC=.79, P=.001) of sleep-related myths. Qualitatively, both ChatGPT and sleep experts refuted sleep-related misconceptions. However, ChatGPT adopted a more accessible style and provided a more generalized view, focusing on broad concepts, while experts sometimes used technical jargon, providing evidence-based explanations.
Conclusions
ChatGPT-4 can accurately address sleep-related queries and debunk sleep-related myths, with a performance comparable to sleep experts, even if, given its limitations, the AI cannot completely replace expert opinions, especially in nuanced and complex fields such as sleep health, but can be a valuable complement in the dissemination of updated information and promotion of healthy behaviors.},

This article introduces blockchain technology as a complementary technological safeguard to address some of these challenges. We emphasize blockchain’s role in promoting transparency, verifiability, and decentralization in AI development and usage, thereby offering potential solutions for four distinct challenges: (1) AI toxicity, biases, hallucinations, (2) AI interest misalignment, (3) AI as a black box, and (4) AI misuse. This article proposes ways to ensure responsible and transparent AI usage through the integration of blockchain. We position the convergence of AI and blockchain as a means to manage AI’s societal impact and unlock its benefits—contingent upon collaborative efforts among various stakeholders such as businesses, developers, and regulatory bodies.

@article{BRITOZERON20252097,
    abstract = {Background:
Complement consumption, characterized by decreased C3 and/or C4 levels, is a hallmark of immune complex-mediated inflammation and vascular involvement in patients with systemic autoimmune diseases. In patients with Sjögren Disease (SjD), hypocomplementemia at diagnosis has been mainly linked to an increased risk of lymphoma. By analysing the relationship between complement consumption profiles and systemic activity in the largest international cohort, we aim to refine early prognostic paradigms and inform tailored clinical surveillance strategies in SjD, thereby addressing a critical gap in precision medicine for this complex autoimmune disease.
Objectives:
The objectives of this study were to identify and classify complement consumption patterns, investigate their association with an early phenotype consisting of systemic activity across ESSDAI domains while adjusting for age and gender, and explore how cross-validation techniques may validate the predictive accuracy and generalizability of developed models.
Methods:
This study analyzed data from the International Sjögren Big Data Registry. Patients were categorized into four distinct groups according to their complement consumption patterns (isolated low C3, isolated low C4, combined low C3 and C4, and normal C3 and C4 levels). We used Chi-square tests to evaluate univariate associations, and Kruskal-Wallis H-test and Mann-Whitney U test to investigate significant differences with respect to systemic activity (mean ESSDAI score and DAS categories). Multivariable logistic regression models were developed to analyze associations between complement patterns and ESSDAI domains, adjusting for age and gender. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. A five-fold stratified cross-validation was carried out to rigorously evaluate the models' generalizability, with the Area Under the Curve (AUC) serving as the primary performance metric. Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) (ChatGPT-4o model) was used within a secure offline environment to automate anonymized data recoding and statistical scripting. Python libraries, including pandas, statsmodels, and scikit-learn, were integral for data processing, model development, and cross-validation.
Results:
Complement values determined at diagnosis were available in 13,710 patients. Stratification according to the 4 complement consumption patterns identified that 79.58% of patients had normal levels of C3 and C4, 7.42% exhibited isolated low C3, 6.90% showed isolated low C4, and 6.09% presented combined low C3 and C4 levels. Combined low C3-C4 levels exhibited the highest mean ESSDAI score (11.41), follwed by isolated low C3, isolated low C4 and normocomplementemia (mean ESSDAI score of 9.26, 7.39, and 5.66, respectively) (Figure 1); Kruskal-Wallis H-test revealed a highly significant difference between the groups (p<0.001), as well as pairwise comparisons using the Mann-Whitney U test (p<0.001). The Chi-square test revealed significant differences in the distribution of DAS categories across the C3-C4 combined groups (χ2=476.41, p<0.001) (Figure 2). However, multivariate logistic regression confirmed significant associations in only three domains. For the pulmonary domain, combined low C3 and C4 levels were associated with the highest odds of activity (OR: 3.12, 95% CI: 2.50–3.91, p < 0.001; AUC: 0.591). In the biological domain, isolated low C3 strongly correlated with activity (OR: 2.45, 95% CI: 1.98–3.03, p < 0.001; AUC: 0.580). For constitutional symptoms, isolated low C3 was associated with the highest activity frequency (18.54%), whereas normal complement levels showed the lowest frequency (11.06%, OR: 0.56, 95% CI: 0.48–0.67, p < 0.001; AUC: 0.563). After adjusting for epidemiological factors, sex and age emerged as influential variables: men had higher odds of constitutional activity (OR 1.24, 95% CI: 1.02–1.52, p = 0.03), while older age had a protective effect, reducing systemic activity by about 1% per year (OR: 0.99, 95% CI: 0.99–1.00, p = 0.0003). The AUC values obtained after running the five-fold stratified cross-validation generalizability models ranged between 0.56 and 0.59, indicating modest ability to discriminate between active and inactive states.
Conclusion:
This study demonstrates that complement consumption patterns are strongly associated with baseline systemic activity in SjD, highlighting their potential as early prognostic markers. While complement patterns provide valuable insights for risk stratification, the current predictive models exhibit modest discriminatory ability (AUC values between 0.5 and 0.6), suggesting that complement patterns are relevant but insufficient alone as predictors to improve clinical applicability. The nuanced influence of epidemiological factors—such as the protective effect of age and the increased susceptibility of men to systemic disease—adds complexity to our understanding of early systemic Sjögren.

    abstract = {Background:
Sarcoidosis is a heterogeneous granulomatous disease characterized by a wide range of clinical manifestations stemming from multiple organ involvement. While clustering techniques offer a robust method for uncovering these patterns, traditional approaches may fail to fully capture the complexity of multisystem diseases like sarcoidosis. Leveraging generative artificial intelligence (AI) offers a unique opportunity to improve data analysis and interpretation in complex systemic settings, providing novel insights into multifaceted disease patterns and guiding both hypothesis generation and clinical decision-making.
Objectives:
This study aimed to identify distinct clusters of organ involvement in patients with sarcoidosis, assess their corresponding epidemiological characteristics, and highlight the benefits of AI-driven methodologies in handling complex multisystem data—underscoring the feasibility and advantages of advanced AI-based approaches for systemic phenotypes in this heterogeneous disease.
Methods:
We conducted an AI-assisted analysis to identify organ-involvement clusters in a dataset of 2,187 anonymized sarcoidosis patients (Spanish National Registry SarcoGEAS, all fulfilling the 1999 ATS/ERS/WASOG criteria). Organ involvement was retrospectively determined in each patient at the time of diagnosis using the 2014 WASOG organ assessment instrument. Clustering was carried out via the k-means algorithm in Python's scikit-learn library (version 1.0.2). The optimal number of clusters was determined using the elbow method, supported by silhouette scores to evaluate cluster quality. Statistical comparisons (ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis, and Chi-square tests—using exact tests for low-frequency data) were applied to characterize cluster differences. Significance was set at p < 0.05, ensuring rigorous evaluation of epidemiological and clinical distinctions. The analysis was conducted in a secure computational environment using generative AI (via OpenAI's GPT-4 model) using Python (version 3.9) with essential libraries including pandas (1.4.3) for data manipulation, numpy (1.21.5) for numerical computations, and matplotlib (3.5.1) and seaborn (0.11.2) for visualizations. Data processing and analysis workflows adhered to GDPR standards to ensure patient privacy. All patient data were anonymized prior to analysis, and no identifiable information was accessed at any point. Code modularity and reproducibility were prioritized, with all scripts managed in version control systems (e.g., Git) to enable transparency.
Results:
The cohort comprised 2,187 patients, with a female predominance (61.4%), a mean age at diagnosis of 48.6 years (range: 5-95), and a majority identifying as White (88%). Cluster quality analysis identified 5 as the optimal number of clusters potential; an additional clinically significant cluster (hepatic-splenic) was manually identified and confirmed post hoc through statistical validation. Ultimately, we defined six distinct clusters of systemic involvement: the lymphadenopathic cluster (Cluster 1, characterized by 100% lymphadenopathy), the pulmonary cluster (Cluster 2, characterized by 100% lung involvement and co-occurring 100% lymphadenopathy), the cutaneous cluster (Cluster 3, 100% of cutaneous involvement), the ocular cluster (Cluster 4, 100% ocular involvement), the hepato-splenic cluster (Cluster 5, defined by 100% hepatic and splenic involvement), and the multisystemic cluster (Cluster 6, exhibiting generalized, but not predominant, organ involvement). Each cluster demonstrated statistically significant epidemiological differences (Figure 1). For age, the lymphadenopathic cluster had the highest mean (51.7 years), whereas the cutaneous cluster had the lowest (42.9 years) (p = 0.00056). For sex, the proportion of females ranged from 49.0% in the hepato-splenic cluster to 65.9% in the ocular cluster (p = 0.000017). For ethnicity, the proportion of White patients ranged from 81.4% in the ocular cluster to 94.6% in the lymphadenopathic cluster (p = 0.00135).
Conclusion:
This generative AI-driven clustering study successfully identified six distinct patterns of systemic involvement in sarcoidosis, offering a deeper understanding of the disease's heterogeneity. Each cluster exhibited specific epidemiological profiles: cutaneous cluster was associated with the youngest age at sarcoidosis diagnosis, lymphadenopathic cluster with the oldest age and the highest frequency of White patients, ocular cluster with the highest frequency of women and highest frequency of non-White patients, and the hepato-splenic cluster with the highest rate of men. The significant epidemiological disparities among clusters underscore the disease's variability and offer a framework for refined patient stratification.

However, its impact on consumer behavior has remained empirically untested. In response to social media platforms mandating the disclosure of GenAI content, we investigate how followers perceive brands that use GenAI for content creation. Drawing from literature on algorithm aversion and brand authenticity, the results of three experimental studies indicate that brands' GenAI adoption induces negative attitudinal and behavioral follower reactions. These effects are mediated by followers' perceptions of brand authenticity and can be triggered by GenAI disclosure. Negative reactions are attenuated if GenAI is used to assist humans in content creation rather than to replace them through automation. Our findings underscore the need for nuance in brands’ GenAI adoption to unlock economic benefits without compromising on relationships with consumers.},

Creative problem-solving methods, in particular, present an intriguing means of researching AI’s capacity to identify problems within ambiguous situations, while also generating relevant, useful solutions that respond to authentic, real-world issues in a meaningful way. This paper examined the performance of three separate AI entries generated by GPT-4o as compared with 68 human team entries from students in grades 7–9 within the competitive World Solutions Challenge offered by the Future Problem Solving Program International (FPSPI). The three entries were blind-scored by trained human evaluators for measures of effectiveness, impact, humaneness, creative strength, and development of action plan. Though all three AI entries scored in the top 15 % for all measures, including achieving the top scores for effectiveness, impact, humaneness, development of action plan, and overall performance, the AI entries were not found to be significantly different than the student control group on the measure of creative strength. The results suggest that AI models like GPT-4 may approach human-like abilities on certain aspects of creative performance during a more comprehensive creative process than divergent thinking alone, providing new insight into the current creative strengths—and limitations—of existing AI models.},

This review focuses on recent progress in deep learning for pulmonary nodule detection, segmentation, and classification. Traditional machine learning methods, such as support vector machines and k-nearest neighbors, have shown limitations, paving the way for advanced approaches like Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, and Generative Adversarial Networks. The integration of ensemble models and novel techniques is also discussed, emphasizing the latest developments in lung cancer diagnosis. Deep learning algorithms, combined with various analytical techniques, have markedly improved the accuracy and efficiency of pulmonary nodule analysis, surpassing traditional methods, particularly in nodule classification. Although challenges remain, continuous technological advancements are expected to further strengthen the role of deep learning in medical diagnostics, especially for early lung cancer detection and diagnosis.

    abstract = {Purpose
The purpose of this study was to explore employees’ perceptions and firsthand experiences of the impact of generative artificial intelligence (AI) productivity tools, specifically Microsoft 365 Copilot, on individual and collective learning processes within a multinational corporation. In doing so, the study provides insights into how these tools can shape workplace learning dynamics, fostering both individual skill development and collaborative knowledge-sharing practices.
Design/methodology/approach
The authors collected responses from 357 participants through a survey that included both multiple-choice and open-ended questions. This study focuses exclusively on the qualitative responses. The reflexive thematic analysis method was used to capture and interpret employees’ perceptions of the role of Microsoft 365 Copilot – a generative AI-powered assistant integrated into the Microsoft 365 suite of applications (e.g., Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Teams) – in enhancing their work and learning opportunities in the workplace.
Findings
The results highlight four key themes contributing to workplace learning. At the individual level, Task Support illustrates the extent to which generative AI productivity tools transform work practices and facilitate both formal and informal learning pathways, while Meaningful Work underscores the tools’ role in enhancing employees’ foundational knowledge through enriched information. At the organisational level, organisational culture suggests the importance of fostering a supportive environment for AI integration, while organisational socialisation highlights its influence on team cohesion and the informal knowledge-sharing processes essential for effective collaboration within and among team members.
Practical implications
The results of this study offer actionable insights for organisations integrating generative AI productivity tools in the workplace. Understanding employees’ perceptions of the role of AI in workplace learning can inform the design of targeted training programmes that promote individual skill development and foster collaborative knowledge sharing. Furthermore, a supportive organisational culture that positions AI as a complementary resource can improve employee engagement, reduce resistance to new technologies and encourage a growth-oriented mindset, ultimately driving both personal and organisational development.
Originality/value
This study shifts the narrative around the role of AI in the workplace by examining how generative AI productivity tools can enhance workplace learning at both individual and organisational levels, rather than focusing solely on their potential to disrupt work through displacement and automation. By positioning AI-based applications as complementary to human work, this approach highlights their potential as enablers of skill development, knowledge sharing and job enrichment, fostering a more adaptive and learning-oriented work environment.},

    abstract = {Background
General awareness and exposure to generative artificial intelligence (AI) have increased recently. This transformative technology has the potential to create a more dynamic and engaging user experience in digital mental health interventions (DMHIs). However, if not appropriately used and controlled, it can introduce risks to users that may result in harm and erode trust. At the time of conducting this trial, there had not been a rigorous evaluation of an approach to safely implementing generative AI in a DMHI.
Objective
This study aims to explore the user relationship, experience, safety, and technical guardrails of a DMHI using generative AI compared with a rules-based intervention.
Methods
We conducted a 2-week exploratory randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 160 adult participants randomized to receive a generative AI (n=81) or rules-based (n=79) version of a conversation-based DMHI. Self-report measures of the user relationship (client satisfaction, working alliance bond, and accuracy of empathic listening and reflection) and experience (engagement metrics, adverse events, and technical guardrail success) were collected. Descriptions and validation of technical guardrails for handling user inputs (eg, detecting potentially concerning language and off-topic responses) and model outputs (eg, not providing medical advice and not providing a diagnosis) are provided, along with examples to illustrate how they worked. Safety monitoring was conducted throughout the trial for adverse events, and the success of technical guardrails created for the generative arm was assessed post trial.
Results
In general, the majority of measures of user relationship and experience appeared to be similar in both the generative and rules-based arms. The generative arm appeared to be more accurate at detecting and responding to user statements with empathy (98% accuracy vs 69%). There were no serious or device-related adverse events, and technical guardrails were shown to be 100% successful in posttrial review of generated statements. A majority of participants in both groups reported an increase in positive sentiment (62% and 66%) about AI at the end of the trial.
Conclusions
This trial provides initial evidence that, with the right guardrails and process, generative AI can be successfully used in a digital mental health intervention (DMHI) while maintaining the user experience and relationship. It also provides an initial blueprint for approaches to technical and conversational guardrails that can be replicated to build a safe DMHI.

    abstract = {Background and objective
Generative artificial intelligence is a technology that provides greater connectivity with people through conversational bots (“chatbots”). These bots can engage in dialogue using natural language indistinguishable from humans and are a potential source of information for patients. The aim of this study is to examine the performance of these bots in solving specific issues related to orthopedic surgery and traumatology using questions from the Spanish MIR exam between 2008 and 2023.
Material and methods
Three “chatbot” models (ChatGPT, Bard and Perplexity) were analyzed by answering 114 questions from the MIR. Their accuracy was compared, the readability of their responses was evaluated, and their dependence on logical reasoning and internal and external information was examined. The type of error was also evaluated in the failures.
Results
ChatGPT obtained 72.81% correct answers, followed by Perplexity (67.54%) and Bard (60.53%). Bard provides the most readable and comprehensive responses. The responses demonstrated logical reasoning and the use of internal information from the question prompts. In 16 questions (14%), all three applications failed simultaneously. Errors were identified, including logical and information failures.
Conclusions
While conversational bots can be useful in resolving medical questions, caution is advised due to the possibility of errors. Currently, they should be considered as a developing tool, and human opinion should prevail over generative artificial intelligence.
Resumen
Antecedentes y objetivo
La inteligencia artificial generativa es una tecnología que ofrece su mayor conectividad con las personas gracias a los bots conversacionales («chatbot»). Estos pueden mantener un diálogo con un lenguaje natural indistinguible del humano y son una fuente potencial de información para los pacientes. El objetivo de este trabajo es estudiar el rendimiento de estos bots en la resolución de cuestiones específicas de cirugía ortopédica y traumatología empleando las preguntas del examen MIR español entre 2008 y 2023.
Material y métodos
Se analizaron 3 modelos de «chatbots» (ChatGPT, Bard y Perplexity) respondiendo a 114 preguntas del MIR. Se compararon aciertos, se valoró la legibilidad de las respuestas y se examinó su dependencia con el razonamiento lógico y la información interna y externa. En los fallos también se evaluó el tipo de error.
Resultados
ChatGPT obtuvo un 72,81% de aciertos, seguido por Perplexity (67,54%) y Bard (60,53%). Las respuestas más legibles y completas las ofrece Bard. Las respuestas demostraron un razonamiento lógico y el uso de información interna de los enunciados de preguntas. En 16 preguntas (14%) las 3 aplicaciones fallaron simultáneamente. Se identificaron errores, que incluían fallos lógicos y de información.
Conclusiones
Aunque los bots conversacionales pueden ser útiles en la resolución de preguntas médicas, se señala la necesidad de precaución debido a la posibilidad de errores. Actualmente deben considerarse como una herramienta en desarrollo, y la opinión humana debe prevalecer sobre la inteligencia artificial generativa.},

However, it is unknown whether different levels of AI are perceived by customers as features increasing humanness and, subsequently, leading to higher functional, monetary, social, or emotional value. Through an experimental design based on tourism chatbots, the results from structural equation analysis reveal that whereas mechanical AI decreases automated social presence, analytical AI increases perceptions of competence and warmth, and emotional AI improves all humanness cues.

In the luxury sector, its incorporation presents a particular complexity, as it requires a delicate balance between technological efficiency and the preservation of the symbolic, aesthetic, and emotional values that shape brand identity. This study aims to explore how professionals within the luxury sector perceive the integration of artificial intelligence and what conditions they consider necessary for the technology to be adopted without compromising exclusivity or the distinctive customer experience. The research followed a qualitative, exploratory methodology, based on semi-structured interviews with experts from various fields related to luxury management, technological innovation, and brand experience. Findings indicate that the acceptance of artificial intelligence in the luxury context depends on its ability to integrate invisibly, reinforce the narrative and emotional dimensions of the experience, and function as a relational infrastructure rather than an autonomous tool. Key strategies identified include its curatorial role in personalization processes and its cross-functional incorporation into collaborative organizational dynamics. From a practical standpoint, these results offer guidance for implementing advanced technologies in environments where cultural and symbolic sensitivity is essential to perceived value. The value of this study lies in proposing an alternative understanding of artificial intelligence as a symbolic mediator rather than a purely technical solution, thereby offering new insights for its application in identity-rich contexts.},

Complex prompting and unreadiness among faculty and students are some of the reported challenges when incorporating generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) into simulation-based education (SBE) in undergraduate healthcare programmes. However, strategies for incorporating GenAI into SBE are unclear. This scoping review identified current evidence on GenAI technology, its role, study outcomes, and strategies to incorporate GenAI into the SBE of undergraduate healthcare programmes.
Methods
The Joanna Briggs Institute methodology for scoping reviews was adopted. Eight electronic databases were searched from inception to January 21, 2025. Two authors independently screened and extracted data. The PAGER framework collated, critiqued, and reported the results.
Results
Eight studies were included. ChatGPT was the most frequently employed GenAI technology in SBE of undergraduate healthcare programmes, to enhance the students’ cognitive and affective learning. Study outcomes focused on usability. Five core strategies were synthesized: (a) establish guidelines on GenAI use; (b) enhance GenAI literacy; (c) enhance competency in GenAI prompting in simulation; (d) ensure pedagogical alignment; and (e) conduct pilot tests.
Conclusions
The findings provide insights into GenAI integration in SBE in undergraduate healthcare programmes. Further studies on the benefits of GenAI when applied to SBE are needed to demonstrate its impact on student learning.},

Three themes emerged: Learning Anew; Disequilibrium and Lack of Rootedness; and Ambiguity about New Norms, New Practices. It was found that teachers work with GenAI in deeply personal, fragmented, and continuously evolving ways. GenAI took the form of novel work companions, enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of some work practices. It also was a disruptor to old habits of thinking, behaviour and practices. Teachers were in a state of disequilibrium in this new world beset by VUCA (volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity). Some felt overwhelmed and ‘at breaking point’. A lack of rootedness in teachers’ beliefs and practices emerged. Teachers were generally against the notions of plagiarism and academic integrity held by students who believed the ends justified the means. However, with new ways of teaching, learning and assessment, many teachers recognised their beliefs and practices would have to change. Thus, in the absence of detailed AI guidelines, they called for the urgent need to establish boundaries and teach AI literacy to promote innovative and responsible use.

    abstract = {Introduction
New modes of assessments are needed to evaluate of the authenticity of student learning in an artificial intelligence (AI) world. In mid-2023, we piloted a new assessment type; a collaborative group multimedia assessment with AI allowance. The aim of the research study was to explore the experiences of students using AI in a multimedia assessment. We further aimed to determine whether these use cases changed student perceptions of the ways AI can be used in learning and assessment.
Methods
Students enrolled in a capstone Pharmacology interdisciplinary unit (n = 40) were included in an exploratory, qualitative case study methodology. Thematic analysis using an AI role-based conceptual framework was used to explore student perceptions of AI use prior to and during their projects from logbooks documenting the assessment process.
Results
AI was initially perceived by students as having a personal tutor-style role, which aligned with the taxonomy with AI acting as an Arbiter (49 %), Oracle (41 %) and Quant (10 %). In contrast to their earlier perceptions, AI was only used in a limited manner in the early stages of assessment in the idea generation in the role as an Oracle (86 %) or in data analytic purposes as a Quant (14 %), (n = 14 cases in 5 groups). No student group used AI to generate written text for the final assessment.
Discussion
Tension between perceived and actual use of AI is indicative of the uncertainty faced by students with the allowance of AI within assessments. Clear guidance for educators and students about how to assess the AI-supported learning process is needed to ensure the integrity of the assessment system.},

ChatGPT 3.5 correctly answered 68.3% (n = 509) and 43.3% (n = 296) of questions from the US and UK dental licensing examinations, respectively. The scores for ChatGPT 4.0 were 80.7% (n = 601) and 62.7% (n = 429), respectively. ChatGPT 4.0 passed both written dental licensing examinations, whilst ChatGPT 3.5 failed. ChatGPT 4.0 answered 327 more questions correctly and 102 incorrectly compared to ChatGPT 3.5 when comparing the 2 versions.
Conclusions
The newer version of GenAI has shown good proficiency in answering multiple-choice questions from dental licensing examinations. Whilst the more recent version of GenAI generally performed better, this observation may not hold true in all scenarios, and further improvements are necessary. The use of GenAI in dentistry will have significant implications for dentist–patient communication and the training of dental professionals.},

Using a snowball sampling method, this study examined the preparedness, practices, and barriers encountered by 89 U.S. teachers in the state of Idaho. Participants were predominantly White, female teachers serving in rural schools. A mixed-methods analysis of survey responses revealed that teachers were generally underprepared for integrating GenAI, with fewer than half incorporating it into their educational practices. Unlike the widespread classroom integration patterns observed with general educational technologies, teachers in this study tended to use GenAI for out-of-classroom duties (i.e., lesson preparation, assessment, and administrative tasks) rather than for real-time teaching and learning. These preferences could be attributed to key barriers teachers faced, including doubts about GenAI's ability to manage risks (i.e., technology value beliefs), reduced human interaction in instruction (i.e., pedagogical beliefs), ethical considerations, and the absence of policies and guidance. This study highlights the need to develop support systems and targeted policies to facilitate teachers' GenAI integration, offering implications for Idaho's education system and the broader U.S. context.},

    abstract = {Objective
Training data fuel and shape the development of artificial intelligence (AI) models. Intensive data requirements are a major bottleneck limiting the success of AI tools in sectors with inherently scarce data. In health care, training data are difficult to curate, triggering growing concerns that the current lack of access to health care by under-privileged social groups will translate into future bias in health care AIs. In this report, we developed an autoencoder to grow and enhance inherently scarce datasets to alleviate our dependence on big data.
Design
Computational study with open-source data.
Subjects
The data were obtained from 6 open-source datasets comprising patients aged 40–80 years in Singapore, China, India, and Spain.
Methods
The reported framework generates synthetic images based on real-world patient imaging data. As a test case, we used autoencoder to expand publicly available training sets of optic disc photos, and evaluated the ability of the resultant datasets to train AI models in the detection of glaucomatous optic neuropathy.
Main Outcome Measures
Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were used to evaluate the performance of the glaucoma detector. A higher AUC indicates better detection performance.
Results
Results show that enhancing datasets with synthetic images generated by autoencoder led to superior training sets that improved the performance of AI models.
Conclusions
Our findings here help address the increasingly untenable data volume and quality requirements for AI model development and have implications beyond health care, toward empowering AI adoption for all similarly data-challenged fields.

This review article looks into the uses and effects of generative artificial intelligence in psychology. We employed a systematic selection process, encompassing papers published between 2015 and 2024 from databases such as Google Scholar, PubMed, and IEEE Xplore, using keywords like “Generative AI in psychology” “ChatGPT and behavior modeling” and “AI in mental health”. First, the paper goes over the fundamental ideas of generative AI and lists its uses in data analysis, behavior modeling, and social interaction simulation. A detailed comparison table has been added to contrast conventional research methodologies with GenAI-based approaches in psychology studies. Next, analyzing the theoretical and ethical issues that generative AI raises for psychological research, it highlights how crucial it is to develop a coherent theoretical framework. This study illustrates the benefits of generative AI in handling vast amounts of data and increasing research efficiency by contrasting traditional research methods with AI-driven methodologies. Regarding particular uses, the study explores how generative AI might be used to simulate social interactions, analyze massive amounts of text, and learn about cognitive processes. Section 5 has been expanded to include discussions on political biases, geographic biases, and other biases. In conclusion, the paper looks forward to the future development of generative AI in psychology research and suggests techniques for improving it. We have included methodological solutions such as the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach and human-in-the-loop systems, as well as data privacy solutions like open-source local LLMs. In summary, generative AI has the potential to revolutionize psychological research, but in order to maintain the moral and scientific integrity of the field, ethical and theoretical concerns must be carefully considered before applying the technology.},

Depression is a widespread mental health disorder that affects quality of life, with traditional treatments often resource-intensive. Studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of CBT-based AI in alleviating depressive symptoms through autonomous mental health management.
Purpose
To evaluate the effect and the integration level of Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy-based artificial intelligence (AI) on autonomous health management in depressive symptoms care.
Methods
This systematic review used the PRISMA methodology and a mixed-methods appraisal tool. Studies included randomized controlled trials using artificial intelligence interventions for depression, analysing theoretical frameworks, intervention designs, and outcomes. Reviews and protocols were excluded. Data sources were searched in the Cochrane Library, CINAHL Plus with Full Text, and PubMed for articles published between October 2019 and October 2024.
Results
Five studies demonstrated that artificial intelligence designs incorporating the Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy guidance framework specifically indicated short-term intervention effectiveness. Of these AI interventions, only partial integration of 54 % implemented a theoretical framework in AI design. Nevertheless, findings revealed a significant 60 % decrease in depressive symptoms among participants who engaged with the AI-based autonomous mental health management, particularly those with moderate-to-severe depression, when grounded in a strong theoretical foundation.
Conclusion
Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy-based artificial intelligence interventions have demonstrated effectiveness in decrease depressive symptoms through patient self-management platforms. The theory-driven approach not only guides the development of AI applications but also facilitates the implementation of automated mental health interventions, thereby reducing the workload of nursing staff. This integration of CBT-guided AI technology empowers patients with self-management tools while optimizing nursing resources in mental health settings.},

This study aimed to investigate the effect of GenAI on performance by examining a key affordance of GenAI—seeking help via question asking. We compared the questions that learners asked GenAI versus a human tutor online during a writing task. Using quantitative ethnographic methods, we found that: (a) participants in the GenAI condition asked significantly more questions compared to those in the Tutor condition; (b) GenAI participants tended to ask one-off questions, while Tutor participants tended to have longer conversational exchanges; (c) GenAI participants tended to question pragmatically, asking direct questions about conceptual and procedural knowledge, while Tutor participants tended to make indirect request for feedback; (d) question asking, as measured by epistemic network analysis, mediated the relationship between experimental condition and performance—the more pragmatic the questions, and thus the more like questions in the GenAI condition, the better the performance; and (e) questions in the GenAI condition were driven by social coordination and knowledge deficits, while questions in the Tutor condition were driven by social coordination and establishing common ground. These findings suggest learners may be less hesitant to admit knowledge deficits and more willing to repair them when interacting with GenAI compared to human tutors. Thus, GenAI can be a useful educational tool when improved performance is the goal and human tutoring may benefit from creating a space where learners are more comfortable revealing a lack of knowledge.},

However, existing literature has paid less attention to how consumers respond to GAI-generated reviews versus human-generated reviews. Moreover, little research has explored whether and why consumers are willing to use GAI to generate online reviews. By conducting two experiments, this study investigates how consumers respond differently to GAI-generated reviews versus human-generated reviews and identifies potential factors that influence consumers’ willingness to use GAI to generate reviews. Findings indicate that although there is no significant difference in consumers’ perceptions between human-generated and GAI-generated reviews in terms of review credibility, review richness, and review usefulness, only half of the participants are willing to use GAI to generate reviews. Further analysis results suggest that individuals who consider GAI unethical tend to avoid using GAI. Those with high personal innovativeness are more willing to use GAI to generate online reviews. Our findings deepen the understanding of consumer attitudes toward GAI-generated reviews and provide implications for the deployment of GAI in the online review system.},

This study introduces two variations of EmotionPrompt strategies, drawing on regulatory focus theory, to explore both individuals' perceptions of GAI ability and their empowerment in self-competence when handling disagreements. An experiment between humans and GAI chatbots in determining product promotion strategy showed that emotional prompts impact individuals' reappraisals of both chatbots and their own performance profoundly, cultivating self-determination in the final decision. Importantly, EmotionPrompt with promotion orientation can increase the perceived flexibility of chatbot decision-makers, facilitating individual self-enhancement and trust in GAI competence. In contrast, the prevention-oriented EmotionPrompt appears to constrain individuals' judgments and decision-making processes, as evidenced by the increased occurrence of inhibit words and anxiety emotions in their reflections. These findings provide novel perspectives on implementing specific regulatory-oriented EmotionPrompt strategies in GAI to address opinion conflicts in decision-making with humans.},

    abstract = {Background
Bioavailability, defined as the extent to which active components in food are absorbed and utilized by the body, is a critical factor in determining the health benefits of food. The intricate interactions of various critical aspects, particularly those concerning extensive, complicated datasets of host conditions and ingredient matrix effects, are obstacles to bioavailability research. These difficulties influence research on intestinal absorption efficiency, solubility, and chemical stability.
Scope and approach
One effective tool for overcoming these challenges is artificial intelligence (AI). AI models can be used to analyse and forecast the bioavailability of food ingredients under various processing conditions and food matrix compositions by analyzing sizable datasets, as well as reveal the effects of these parameters. The aims of this review are to provide a theoretical foundation for AI-based bioavailability research, describe applicable methods, outline prospective research directions for AI-based innovation in food science and nutrition, and address existing difficulties.
Key findings and conclusions
The use of AI in bioavailability research on proteins, peptides, carbohydrates, and micronutrients has transformative potential. AI-based models can be used to simultaneously deduce structures, optimize excipient ingredients, devise distribution systems, offer research guidance and minimize experimental trials. However, the application of these models is hampered by the following factors: (1) the absence of high-quality standardized datasets that accurately represent biological complexity, which may result in model overfitting and bias; (2) the restricted mechanistic interpretability of "black box" algorithms, which impedes regulatory approval and scientific validation; and (3) interdisciplinary validation challenges between computational predictions and in vitro and in vivo experimental outcomes.},

    abstract = {Purpose of review
WHO defines SCD as sudden unexpected death either within 1 h of symptom onset (witnessed) or within 24 h of having been observed alive and symptom-free (unwitnessed). Sudden cardiac arrest is a major cause of mortality worldwide, with survival to hospital discharge for hospital cardiac arrest and in-hospital cardiac arrest being only 9.3 % and 21.2 %, respectively, despite treatment highlighting the importance of effectively predicting and preventing cardiac arrest. This literature review aims to explore the role and application of AI (Artificial Intelligence) in predicting and preventing sudden cardiac arrest.
Material and methods
Eligible studies were searched from PubMed and Web of Science. The inclusion criteria were fulfilled if sudden cardiac death prediction and prevention, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning were included.
Conclusions
Artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning have shown remarkable prospects in SCA risk stratification, which can improve the survival rate from SCA. Nonetheless, they have not been adequately trained and tested, necessitating further studies with explainable techniques, larger sample sizes, external validation, more diverse patient samples, multimodal tools, ethics, and bias mitigation to unlock their full potential.},

    abstract = {Introduction Thrombotic microangiopathies (TMA), with etiologies ranging from benign to life-threatening, necessitates rapid and accurate diagnosis, particularly for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), to initiate timely plasmapheresis preventing severe outcomes. Diagnosing TTP is challenging due to overlapping clinical features with other causes of TMA, such as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), compounded by that specific diagnostic tests such as biopsies or ADAMTS13 activity assays do not result immediately. This study explored GPT-4's capability in suggesting differential diagnoses for TMA patients and identifying a provisional diagnosis of TTP based on clinical presentation and basic diagnostic workup to determine the need for prompt plasmapheresis, assessing its potential as a diagnostic support tool. Method We utilized open-access case reports from PubMed Central that provided a comprehensive list of cases with diagnosis of TMA. The exclusion criteria included cases with no access, copyright permission issues, preprints, insufficient description, non-case reports, non-English language, and no established diagnosis for TMA. Each case input including only the history and physical examination (H&P) and basic diagnostic workup excluding the confirmatory diagnosis was presented to GPT-4 in three separate trials and was prompted to provide clinical reasoning that both favored or rejected the diagnosis of TTP, create a top three differential diagnoses list selected from a comprehensive list of TMA diagnoses, and determine the necessity of plasmapheresis. Generated results were subsequently compared with the confirmed case diagnosis and management provided within the case report. Result An initial PubMed Central search identified 424 cases; 326 were excluded, resulting in 98 eligible cases. The top three differential diagnoses generated for each case in all three trials exhibited relatively higher F1-scores for ITP, TTP, HUS, and HELLP syndrome, with values of 0.58, 0.59, 0.53, and 0.7, respectively. Other causes of TMA scored below 0.5. Overall performance metrics indicated a specificity of 0.85, sensitivity of 0.80, precision of 0.28, and an F1-score of 0.42. When grouped into TTP versus non-TTP cases, the sensitivity was notably high at 0.98, showing that GPT-4 could adequately rule out TTP, although the specificity was 0.76. When comparing the case diagnosis with the primary diagnosis within the top three differential diagnoses, the overall specificity was 0.96, sensitivity was 0.56, precision was 0.58, and the F1-score was 0.57. The match rate of GPT-4 suggesting plasmapheresis compared to the case report was 76%. In cases confirmed as TTP, GPT-4 demonstrated 100% accuracy in recommending plasmapheresis. For non-TTP cases, GPT-4 showed a 66% match rate compared to the case report's decision to initiate plasmapheresis, indicating a 34% reduction in suggesting plasmapheresis for these cases. Error analysis revealed that errors were primarily due to GPT-4 ignoring pertinent findings, inaccurate knowledge, and confounding symptoms or findings within the case report itself. Discussion This study demonstrated that GPT-4 could adequately assist in the diagnosis of TMA and provide suggestions for early management of TTP based on clinical presentation and basic diagnostic workup. GPT-4 appropriately recommended plasmapheresis for TTP cases and showed a comparable performance of that of a clinically commonly used tool in these settings, PLASMIC score. However, in our study, GPT-4 made errors such as ignoring pertinent findings and demonstrating incomplete knowledge, highlighting the need for pretraining and areas to improve regarding diagnosis of TMA. The study suggested that GPT-4 could be integrated as a diagnostic support tool, especially for complex, time-sensitive conditions, while emphasizing that it should complement, not replace, clinical judgment.},

Applications cover diverse imaging modalities, including those based on electromagnetic radiation (e.g., X-rays), subatomic particles (e.g., nuclear imaging), and acoustic waves (ultrasound). Each modality features and limitations are defined by its underlying physics. However, many artificial intelligence practitioners lack a solid understanding of the physical principles involved in medical image acquisition. This gap hinders leveraging the full potential of deep learning, as incorporating physics knowledge into artificial intelligence systems promotes trustworthiness, especially in limited data scenarios. This work reviews the fundamental physical concepts behind medical imaging and examines their influence on recent developments in artificial intelligence, particularly, generative models and reconstruction algorithms. Finally, we describe physics-informed machine learning approaches to improve feature learning in medical imaging.},

    abstract = {Introduction
The use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has begun to permeate most industries, including medicine, and patients will inevitably start using these large language model (LLM) chatbots as a modality for education. As healthcare information technology evolves, it is imperative to evaluate chatbots and the accuracy of the information they provide to patients and to determine if there is variability between them.
Objective
This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy and comprehensiveness of three chatbots in addressing questions related to endometriosis and determine the level of variability between them.
Study Design
Three LLMs, including Chat GPT-4 (Open AI), Claude (Anthropic), and Bard (Google) were asked to generate answers to 10 commonly asked questions about endometriosis. The responses were qualitatively compared to current guidelines and expert opinion on endometriosis and rated on a scale by nine gynecologists. The grading scale included the following: (1) Completely incorrect, (2) mostly incorrect and some correct, (3) mostly correct and some incorrect, (4) correct but inadequate, (5) correct and comprehensive. Final scores were averaged between the nine reviewers. Kendall's W and the related chi-square test were used to evaluate the reviewers’ strength of agreement in ranking the LLMs’ responses for each item.
Results
Average scores for the 10 answers amongst Bard, Chat GPT, and Claude were 3.69, 4.24, and 3.7, respectively. Two questions showed significant disagreement between the nine reviewers. There were no questions the models could answer comprehensively or correctly across the reviewers. The model most associated with comprehensive and correct responses was ChatGPT. Chatbots showed an improved ability to accurately answer questions about symptoms and pathophysiology over treatment and risk of recurrence.
Conclusion
The analysis of LLMs revealed that, on average, they mainly provided correct but inadequate responses to commonly asked patient questions about endometriosis. While chatbot responses can serve as valuable supplements to information provided by licensed medical professionals, it is crucial to maintain a thorough ongoing evaluation process for outputs to provide the most comprehensive and accurate information to patients. Further research into this technology and its role in patient education and treatment is crucial as generative AI becomes more embedded in the medical field.},

Despite the widespread use of therapies aimed at improving symptoms and quality of life, effective pain management is essential to enhance the quality of life of individuals affected by this disease. However, a detailed understanding of the factors associated with pain in PD is still evolving. In this study, we examined the disability caused by pain and the pain experienced by PD patients using two validated questionnaires, namely the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ) and the King's Parkinson's Disease Pain Questionnaire (KPPQ). Customized questions were also included to further explore the pain experience and management strategies adopted by PD patients. Through statistical analysis, we explored the relationships between questionnaire scores, socio-demographic data, and other relevant variables. Additionally, generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) was employed to gain a deeper understanding of patient responses. The results indicate the extent and impact of pain in PD and provide valuable insights for more targeted and personalized management. This study lays the foundation for future research and the development of interventions aimed at improving the quality of life for individuals affected by this condition.},

    abstract = {Introduction
Large language models like Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (ChatGPT) are increasingly used in academic writing. Faculty may consider use of artificial intelligence (AI)–generated responses a form of cheating. We sought to determine whether general surgery residency faculty could detect AI versus human-written responses to a text prompt; hypothesizing that faculty would not be able to reliably differentiate AI versus human-written responses.
Methods
Ten essays were generated using a text prompt, “Tell us in 1-2 paragraphs why you are considering the University of Rochester for General Surgery residency” (Current trainees: n = 5, ChatGPT: n = 5). Ten blinded faculty reviewers rated essays (ten-point Likert scale) on the following criteria: desire to interview, relevance to the general surgery residency, overall impression, and AI- or human-generated; with scores and identification error rates compared between the groups.
Results
There were no differences between groups for %total points (ChatGPT 66.0 ± 13.5%, human 70.0 ± 23.0%, P = 0.508) or identification error rates (ChatGPT 40.0 ± 35.0%, human 20.0 ± 30.0%, P = 0.175). Except for one, all essays were identified incorrectly by at least two reviewers. Essays identified as human-generated received higher overall impression scores (area under the curve: 0.82 ± 0.04, P < 0.01).
Conclusions
Whether use of AI tools for academic purposes should constitute academic dishonesty is controversial. We demonstrate that human and AI-generated essays are similar in quality, but there is bias against presumed AI-generated essays. Faculty are not able to reliably differentiate human from AI-generated essays, thus bias may be misdirected. AI-tools are becoming ubiquitous and their use is not easily detected. Faculty must expect these tools to play increasing roles in medical education.},

There are numerous debates on how GenAI would fundamentally change existing business models. However, there is not much discussion on roles of generative AI in the domain of social good. Broader views covering potential opportunities of GenAI to enable diverse initiatives in the social good space are largely missing. We intend to reduce the gap by developing a classification framework that should allow researchers gauge the potential impact of GenAI for social good initiatives. Through case analysis, we assess how value-added abilities of GenAI may influence various social good initiatives. We adopt/develop two loosely connected classification frameworks that are grounded in task-technology fit (TTF) theory. Subsequently, we investigate how our analyses of GenAI initiatives utilizing different dimensions of these two frameworks may be synthesized to provide appropriate explanation for potential success of GenAI for social good. We develop five propositions that will provide guidance to practitioners and researchers. The theoretically grounded analysis of 21 GenAI for social good use cases based on the two classification frameworks, and the resulting propositions are the original contributions of this paper to the AI for social good literature.},

    abstract = {Introduction
In Australia, almost 50 % of paramedics are female yet they remain under-represented in stereotypical depictions of the profession. The potentially transformative value of generative artificial intelligence (AI) may be limited by stereotypical errors, misrepresentations and bias. Increasing use of text-to-image generative AI, like DALL-E 3, could reinforce gender and ethnicity biases and, therefore, is important to objectively evaluate.
Method
In March 2024, DALL-E 3 was utilised via GPT-4 to generate a series of individual and group images of Australian paramedics, ambulance officers, police officers and firefighters. In total, 82 images were produced including 60 individual-character images, and 22 multiple-character group images. All 326 depicted characters were independently analysed by three reviewers for apparent gender, age, skin tone and ethnicity.
Results
Among first responders, 90.8 % (N = 296) were depicted as male, 90.5 % (N = 295) as Caucasian, 95.7 % (N = 312) as a light skin tone, and 94.8 % (N = 309) as under 55 years of age. For paramedics and police the gender distribution was a statistically significant variation from that of actual Australian workforce data (all p < 0.001). Among the images of individual paramedics and ambulance officers (N = 32), DALL-E 3 depicted 100 % as male, 100 % as Caucasian and 100 % with light skin tone.
Conclusion
Gender and ethnicity bias is a significant limitation for text-to-image generative AI using DALL-E 3 among Australian first responders. Generated images have a disproportionately high misrepresentation of males, Caucasians and light skin tones that are not representative of the diversity of paramedics in Australia today.},

First, the study aims to identify and characterize the significant genes associated with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) using three GenAI models (GPT‑4o, Gemini model, and DeepSeek). After the genes were accumulated from GenAI models, 27 genes associated with AD were recoded. Furthermore, they were analyzed using integrative bioinformatics methods. Similarly, the immune landscape of AD using single-cell analysis was also explored, which reveals a high percentage of effector CD8+ T cells (33.42%) and naive T cells (45.95%). The single-cell study found that effector memory T cells have two subsets. It also found that the macrophage population has started to spread and dendritic cells have decreased in Alzheimer’s patients. The single-cell gene expression study reveals the top ten highly expressed genes (NDUFV2, CAT, MRPS34, PBX3, THOC2, CCDC57, PBXIP1, SDHAF3, PPP4C, and MAP3K8). The clonal frequency indicates that CD8+ T and naive T cell populations show the highest clonal frequency in healthy and AD individuals and are further noted them in the clonotype cell proportion study.

    abstract = {Background
Coronary artery disease (CAD) manifests differently between sexes, with data suggesting females develop more non-calcified plaques that traditional calcium-centric tools may not detect.
Methods
We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 100 individuals with low total atheroma volume (TAV) < 250 mm3 using artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) to assess sex-based differences in coronary plaque composition. Plaque subtypes included calcified, non-calcified, and low-density non-calcified atheroma volumes.
Results
Females had significantly lower total (p = 0.018) and non-calcified plaque (p < 0.001) burden compared to males. Calcified (p = 0.52) and low-density non-calcified (p = 0.16) plaque volumes did not differ significantly. Age was a consistent predictor of plaque volume across most subtypes.
Conclusions
Despite low overall plaque burden, males demonstrated a higher non-calcified plaque burden than females. This finding contrasts with previous literature and underscores the potential of AI-enabled CCTA to detect subclinical coronary disease, particularly in low-risk cohorts. These results support the use of comprehensive plaque profiling in both sexes to improve early risk stratification.},

Background
Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging enables imaging of scar/fibrosis and is a cornerstone of most CMR imaging protocols. CMR imaging can benefit from image acceleration; however, image acceleration in LGE remains challenging due to its limited signal-to-noise ratio. In this study, we sought to evaluate a rapid two-dimensional (2D) LGE imaging protocol using a generative artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm with inline reconstruction.
Methods
A generative AI-based image enhancement was used to improve the sharpness of 2D LGE images acquired with low spatial resolution in the phase-encode direction. The generative AI model is an image enhancement technique built on the enhanced super-resolution generative adversarial network. The model was trained using balanced steady-state free-precession cine images, readily used for LGE without additional training. The model was implemented inline, allowing the reconstruction of images on the scanner console. We prospectively enrolled 100 patients (55 ± 14 years, 72 males) referred for clinical CMR at 3T. We collected three sets of LGE images in each subject, with in-plane spatial resolutions of 1.5 × 1.5-3-6 mm2. The generative AI model enhanced in-plane resolution to 1.5 × 1.5 mm2 from the low-resolution counterparts. Images were compared using a blur metric, quantifying the perceived image sharpness (0 = sharpest, 1 = blurriest). LGE image sharpness (using a 5-point scale) was assessed by three independent readers.
Results
The scan times for the three imaging sets were 15 ± 3, 9 ± 2, and 6 ± 1 s, with inline generative AI-based images reconstructed time of ∼37 ms. The generative AI-based model improved visual image sharpness, resulting in lower blur metric compared to low-resolution counterparts (AI-enhanced from 1.5 × 3 mm2 resolution: 0.3 ± 0.03 vs 0.35 ± 0.03, P < 0.01). Meanwhile, AI-enhanced images from 1.5 × 3 mm2 resolution and original LGE images showed similar blur metric (0.30 ± 0.03 vs 0.31 ± 0.03, P = 1.0) Additionally, there was an overall 18% improvement in image sharpness between AI-enhanced images from 1.5 × 3 mm2 resolution and original LGE images in the subjective blurriness score (P < 0.01).
Conclusion
The generative AI-based model enhances the image quality of 2D LGE images while reducing the scan time and preserving imaging sharpness. Further evaluation in a large cohort is needed to assess the clinical utility of AI-enhanced LGE images for scar evaluation, as this proof-of-concept study does not provide evidence of an impact on diagnosis.},

    abstract = {Narratives surrounding Artificial Intelligence (AI) shape its societal reception, technological development, and regulatory framing. This article proposes a theoretical model to interpret these narratives, especially in the context of growing public engagement with generative AI technologies. The model is structured along three key coordinates: apocalypse, assistance and transcendence. Transitions between them are understood through two dominant narrative frames: the Pandora's Box frame (associated with loss of control), and the Social Progress frame (associated with the improvement of human life), each tending toward dystopian and utopian extremes, respectively. Based on this model, two questions are addressed: What types of AI stories predominate in popular culture? And do audiences actually align with them? To answer these, two empirical analyses are conducted. First, a review of the 300 highest-grossing science fiction films in North America reveals a rich variety of narratives across the entire spectrum, rather than clustering around opposing extremes. Second, focus group discussions with categorized audiences of varying levels of familiarity with AI technology show that they align progressively along the narrative spectrum: the general public tends toward apocalyptic framings, the interested public (in science and technology) focuses on assistance narratives, and the engaged public embraces improvement scenarios. This sequential distribution suggests a strong correlation between AI proximity and narrative positioning, with greater engagement associated with more positive —yet nuanced— views of AI. The model opens multiple avenues for future research, including the use of wider data sources, cross-cultural comparisons, longitudinal studies, tracking of narrative shifts, and focused analyses of more complex representations.},

However, there is limited evidence pertaining to the impact of AI-mediated instruction on postgraduate students’ psycho-affective factors and the overall learning climate in English as a foreign language (EFL) context. To address this gap, the present study drew on motivational climate theory (MCT) to explore postgraduate EFL students’ perceptions of the role of GAI technologies in their emotional engagement and goal orientation. To do so, an interview was conducted with 30 postgraduate students using maximum variation sampling. The results of the inductive thematic analysis revealed that AI-mediated instruction had affected both the emotional engagement and goal orientation of the students. In particular, it was found that GAI tools fostered emotional engagement by ‘enlightening teacher-student classroom relationships’, ‘making the overall classroom culture/climate engaging, motivating, and updated’, ‘improving teachers’ action, instruction, and feedback quality’, ‘providing a personalized, interactive, and autonomy supporting education’, and ‘taping into learner-specific idiosyncrasies and individual differences’. Furthermore, GAI tools affected the students’ goal orientation by ‘facilitating the mastery of course content’, ‘setting personalized and achievable goals’, ‘fostering students’ performance comparison in the classroom’, and ‘providing a reflective and adaptive learning environment’. The findings are discussed and implications are provided for EFL teachers, students, teacher educators, and policymakers concerning the interplay of GAI, emotions, goal orientation, and motivational climate.},

In this paper, we revised and expanded upon the TTT; by including a new stage of assessment (i.e. testing simulated conversations) and providing further guidance on the phases of the TTT. First, the CA is tested in a safe environment with simulated clients (with Gen AI), instead of human clients; second, the TTT is conducted with a selected sample of actual users; and third, the TTT is conducted with a large sample of users.

It begins by outlining the foundational concepts and model characteristics that make machine learning systems particularly susceptible to adversarial manipulation. A structured taxonomy of attack types is presented, including distinctions based on attacker knowledge, goals, timing, and computational frequency. The clinical implications of these attacks are then examined across key radiology tasks, with literature highlighting risks to disease classification, image segmentation and reconstruction, and report generation. Potential downstream consequences such as patient harm, operational disruption, and loss of trust are discussed. Current mitigation strategies are reviewed, spanning input-level defenses, model training modifications, and certified robustness approaches. In parallel, the role of broader lifecycle and safeguard strategies are considered.

    abstract = {Investigating the crucial role of artificial intelligence in enhancing ESG performance is of utmost importance, particularly for advancing the energy transition. In this study, we utilise the wavelet-based quantile on quantile regression (QQR) to capture the evolving impact of the Artificial Intelligence Enabler Index (AII) on the Global ESG Index (ESGI). Based on raw data, AII's impact on ESGI varies across different quantiles, indicating artificial intelligence doesn't always boost ESG performance. We use wavelet analysis to explore AII's effects on ESGI over various time horizons. AII has more negative impacts in the short term due to early technology stages, slow social adaptation, and limited ESG awareness. However, in the medium to long term, AII's positives may outweigh its negatives, fueled by technological progress, efficiency gains, wider ESG adoption, and artificial intelligence applications in ESG. Hence, our analysis reveals that artificial intelligence's inhibitory effect on ESG performance is more pronounced in the short run. Still, its enhancement effect becomes significant over the medium to long term. In the face of a new technological revolution and industrial transformation, we will offer practical advice to boost ESG progress using artificial intelligence while simultaneously fostering energy transition.},

    abstract = {As urbanization accelerates, aging infrastructure demands more advanced inspection methods for structural health monitoring. The growing integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer vision technologies has significantly enhanced damage detection accuracy while simultaneously reducing inspection time and operational costs. Despite these advantages, the adoption of AI-based technologies in infrastructure maintenance remains limited due to challenges related to data. One major issue is the lack of comprehensive, task-specific annotated datasets. Another is the poor quality of images captured by drones or mobile devices, which are often affected by noise, blurring, and inconsistent lighting. Although recent advances in generative AI offer promising support for structural health monitoring, it remains unclear which models are best suited for specific tasks. This study examines the use of generative AI in structural health monitoring, focusing on key challenges such as limited datasets and low-quality image restoration. The review covers a range of generative AI technologies, outlining their principles, strengths, limitations, and representative applications to support the selection of appropriate tools for specific tasks. Generative AI models enable accurate image segmentation and structural anomaly detection using limited training data. The paper also explores new opportunities for integrating multi-modal generative AI to enhance human–computer interaction in support of structural health monitoring. A framework is proposed to streamline the use of generative AI technologies for data augmentation, image restoration, damage inspection, and human–computer interaction in structural health monitoring.},

    abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed agricultural genetics, especially in the context of crop improvement strategies. Traditional breeding faces challenges such as polyploidy, high level of genomic heterogeneity, and complex gene-trait associations. By combining multi-omics data researchers learn more about the genetic and molecular basis of important agricultural traits. However, statistical methods are often insufficient to address the data complexity. By contrast, AI techniques, such as machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), are emerging as powerful tools to explore complexity. Algorithms such as random forests (RF) and support vector machines (SVM) can support genomic selection (GS) and trait value prediction. Furthermore, DL models such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) and long short-term memory networks (LSTM) dominate high-throughput phenotyping and time series analyses, providing accurate predictions for crop yield, disease resistance, and genotype adaptation. Large language models (LLMs) are able to integrate complex omics data. AI models can analyze large dataset, generated by genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and phenomic applications because algorithms can combine different inputs, such as DNA sequences, gene expression profiles, protein–protein interaction networks, metabolite concentrations, and phenotypic data under specific environmental conditions. The integration of individual models can improve prediction accuracy by reducing resource inputs and automating labor-intensive tasks involved in breeding programs. Some recent AI methods, such as gradient boosting machines (GBMs) and Transformer models, are increasingly being used to improve scalability and accuracy of predictive analytics. This review summarizes major advances in AI applications in agricultural genetics, highlighting the strengths and limitations of different ML and DL models and their role in integrating complex datasets. The study highlights the importance of artificial intelligence in understanding genomic complexity and promoting the development of innovative methods to improve crop performance.},

This study investigates how entrepreneurship education influences e-entrepreneurial intention through e-entrepreneurial self-efficacy, with generative artificial intelligence incorporation as a moderating factor. The study uses the stimulus-organism-response (SOR) framework to comprehensively understand the relationship between educational, psychological and technological factors in fostering e-entrepreneurship among university students.
Design/methodology/approach
A quantitative study was conducted using survey data collected from 504 university students in Vietnam. The PROCESS macro was employed to test the mediating role of e-entrepreneurial self-efficacy and the moderating effect of generative artificial intelligence incorporation on the relationships among entrepreneurship education, e-entrepreneurial self-efficacy and intention.
Findings
The results demonstrate that entrepreneurship education significantly influences both e-entrepreneurial self-efficacy and intention. E-entrepreneurial self-efficacy mediates the relationship between entrepreneurship education and intention. Generative artificial intelligence incorporation amplifies the effects of entrepreneurship education and e-entrepreneurial self-efficacy on intention, both directly and indirectly, highlighting its role as a transformative driver in e-entrepreneurship.
Practical implications
The findings suggest that integrating generative artificial intelligence tools and entrepreneurship-focused education into training programs can enhance students’ digital entrepreneurial skills. Policymakers and educators should develop strategies to foster digital literacy and entrepreneurial competence to prepare students for technology-driven business environments.
Originality/value
This study contributes to the literature by extending the stimulus-organism-response framework to e-entrepreneurship. It uniquely integrates educational, psychological and technological factors, offering new insights into the mechanisms that foster e-entrepreneurial intention in emerging markets.},

    abstract = {This review applies a transformer-based topic model to reveal trends and relationships in Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven facade research, with a focus on architectural, environmental, and structural aspects. AI methods reviewed include Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and Computer Vision (CV). Overall, a significantly growing interest in applying AI methods can be observed across all research areas. However, noticeable differences exist between the three topics. While CV and DL techniques are applied to image data in research on the architectural design of facades, research on environmental aspects of facades often uses numerical data with relatively small datasets and classical ML models. Research on facade structure also tends to use image data but also incorporates numerical performance prediction. A major limitation remains a lack of generalizability, which could be addressed by more comprehensive datasets and novel DL techniques. These include concepts such as Physics-Informed Neural Networks, where domain knowledge is integrated into hybrid data-driven models, and multi-modal diffusion models, which offer generative modeling capabilities to support inverse and forward design tasks. The trends and directions outlined in this review suggest that AI will continue to advance facade research and, in line with other domains, has the potential to achieve a level of maturity suitable for adoption beyond academia and into practice.},

    abstract = {Data sharing is often hindered by concerns of patient privacy, regulatory aspects, and proprietary interests thereby impeding scientific progress and establishing a gatekeeping mechanism in clinical medicine since obtaining large data sets is costly and time-consuming. We employed two different generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies: CTAB-GAN+ and Normalizing Flows (NFlow) to synthesize clinical trial data based on pooled patient data from four previous multicenter clinical trials of the German Study Alliance Leukemia (AML96, AML2003, AML60+, SORAML) that enrolled adult patients (n=1606) with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who received intensive induction therapy. As a generative adversarial network (GAN), CTAB-GAN+ consists of two adversarial networks: a generator producing synthetic samples from random noise and a discriminator aiming to distinguish between real and synthetic samples. The model converges as the discriminator can no longer reliably differentiate between real or synthetic data. Contrastingly, NFlow consists of a sequence of invertible transformations (flows) starting from a simple base distribution and gradually adding complexity to better mirror the training data. Both models were trained on tabular data including demographic, laboratory, molecular genetic and cytogenetic patient variables. Detection of molecular alterations in the original cohort was performed via next-generation sequencing (NGS) using the TruSight Myeloid Sequencing Panel (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) with a 5% variant-allele frequency (VAF) mutation calling cut-off. For cytogenetics, standard techniques for chromosome banding and fluorescence-in-situ-hybridization (FISH) were used. Hyperparameter tuning of generative models was conducted using the Optuna Framework. For each model, we used a total of 70 optimization trials to optimize a custom score inspired by TabSynDex which assesses both the resemblance of the synthetic data to real training data and its utility. Pairwise analyses were conducted between the original and both synthetic data sets, respectively. All tests were carried out as two-sided tests using a significance level α of 0.05. Table 1 summarizes baseline patient characteristics and outcome for both synthetic cohorts compared to the original cohort. Firstly, we found both models to adequately represent patient features, albeit that some individual variables showed a statistically significant deviation from the original cohort. It is important to note that for such a large sample size (n=1606 for each cohort), even miniscule differences can be rendered statistically significant notwithstanding any meaningful clinical difference. Interestingly, variables that deviated from the original distribution were different for both models indicating model architecture to play a vital role in sample representation: While CTAB-GAN+ showed significant deviations for both age and sex, NFlow showed significant deviations for AML status. Complete remission rate was similar between original (70.7%, odds ratio [OR]: 2.41) and CTAB-GAN+ (73.7%, OR: 2.81, p=0.059) and NFlow (69.1%, OR: 2.24, p=0.356). For event-free survival (EFS), which was not included as a target in hyperparameter tuning, both networks deviated significantly from the original cohort (original: median 7.2 months, HR: 1.36; CTAB-GAN+: median 12.8 months, HR 0.74, p<0.001; NFlow: median 9.0 months, HR: 0.87, p=0.001). Overall survival (OS) was well represented by NFlow compared to the original cohort, while CTAB-GAN+ showed a significant deviation (original: median 17.5 months, HR: 1.14; CTAB-GAN+: median 19.5 months, HR 0.88, p<0.001; NFlow: median 16.2 months, HR: 1.00, p=0.055). Both models showed an adequate graph representation in Kaplan-Meier analysis (Figure 1). Here, we demonstrate using two different generative AI technologies that synthetic data generation provides an attractive solution to circumvent issues in current standards of data collection and sharing. It effectively allows for bypassing logistical, organizational, and financial burdens, as well as regulatory and ethical concerns. Ultimately, this enables explorative research inquiries into previously inaccessible data sets and offers the prospect of fully synthetic control arms in prospective clinical trials.},

    abstract = {Recent advancements in sensor technology and generative artificial intelligence (AI) are transforming precision livestock farming by enhancing behaviour monitoring and predictive analytics. This study examines the effectiveness of Transformer-type generative AI models in predicting cattle behaviour profiles and imputing missing data from collar accelerometer readings collected during two trials in Queensland, Australia, in 2022 and 2023, alongside climatic data. Each trial involved 60 cattle equipped with collars that classified six core behaviours: grazing, ruminating, walking, resting, drinking, and other over five-second time windows. Hourly behaviour profiles were constructed for each animal and experiment day by aggregating the behaviour predictions over every calendar hour, representing the time spent on each behaviour within each hour. Subsequently, four Transformer-type models (i.e., standard Transformer, Informer, Reformer, and Autoformer) were trained on the hourly behaviour profile data to predict behaviour profiles of the next 24 hours for each animal. Among the considered models, Autoformer showed the highest predictive accuracy when including climate data, achieving a mean absolute error (MAE) of <5.5 min, while the next best model had an MAE of approximately 6 min. For imputing missing data, the standard Transformer outperformed traditional imputation methods, with an MAE of <30 min over 24 hours, compared to 40 to 70 min for traditional methods (mean, median, and linear interpolation). These results highlight the potential of generative AI, particularly Autoformer and Transformer, to enhance predictive accuracy and data imputation in livestock management, thereby supporting regulatory guidance for data-driven decision-making and improved farming practices.},

While generative artificial intelligence (GAI) has the potential to revolutionize green logistics, several barriers still prevent its widespread adoption. In existing literature, little is known about applications, drivers, enablers, critical barriers, and challenges associated with implementing GAI along with green logistics. To fill this gap, this study aims to systematically identify and assess the existing body of knowledge on the GAI and green logistics nexus, drawing on a systematic literature review carried out in compliance with the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) protocol. The study identifies 34 key GAI-driven green logistics applications, 23 drivers and enablers, and 38 major barriers and challenges. The findings illustrate that GAI-driven green logistics applications, such as risk assessment and mitigation, decision support and real-time environmental response, resilience testing and scenario planning, are essential for developing sustainable logistics ecosystems. Organizational readiness, stakeholder collaboration, and supportive regulatory frameworks emerge as crucial enablers, while lack of digital infrastructure, investment costs, and regulatory gaps constitute significant barriers. The study proposes a decision-making framework to prioritize policy initiatives that could promote GAI adoption in green logistics.

    abstract = {Interstellar missions will require a high degree of autonomy mediated through artificial intelligence (AI). All interstellar missions are characterised by 50-100-year transits to extrasolar systems. High system availability demands that interstellar spacecraft are self-repairable imposing significant demands on onboard intelligence. We review the current status of artificial intelligence to assess its capabilities in providing such autonomy. In particular, we focus on hybrid AI methods as these appear to offer the richest capabilities in offsetting weaknesses inherent in paradigmic approaches. Symbolic manipulation systems offer logical and comprehensible rationality with predictable behaviours but are brittle beyond their specific applications (a charge that may be levelled at neural networks unless the transfer learning problem can be resolved). More modern approaches to expert systems include Bayesian networks that incorporate probabilistic treatment to accommodate uncertainty. Artificial neural networks are fundamentally different. They are opaque to analysis but potentially offer greater adaptability in application by virtue of their ability to learn. Indeed, deep machine learning is a variation on neural networks with unsupervised neural front ends and supervised neural back ends. Reinforcement learning offers a promising approach for learning directly from the environment. There are inherent weaknesses in neural approaches regarding their hidden mechanisms rendering their distributed representations opaque to analysis. Hybridising symbolic processing techniques with artificial neural networks appears to offer the advantages of both. Human cognition appears to implement both neural learning and symbolic processing. There are several approaches to such hybridisation that we explore including knowledge-based artificial neural networks, fuzzy neural networks, Bayesian methods such as Markov logic networks and genetic methods such as learning classifier systems. Markov logic networks propose a natural correlation between Bayesian probability and neural weights but mapping representation of symbols into switching neurons is less clear (though vector symbolic architectures present an approach) while learning classifier systems are reinforcement learning methods that are promising for interacting with the physical world. We conclude that current AI may not yet be up to the task of interstellar transits and flybys let alone for physical interaction with unknown planetary environments. Certainly, AI is incapable of interactive encounters with extraterrestrial intelligence.},

Here, the authors describe how models of machine learning like random forests, support vector machines (SVM), and artificial neural networks (ANN) can be used to predict degradation efficiency under pH, light intensity, and catalyst loading conditions in particular. Methods like transfer learning improve model generalizability to systems. AI also enables the identification of new photocatalysts and reduces the necessity for large-scale experimental screening. Hybridization of kinetic models like Langmuir-Hinshelwood with ML enables more stringent predictions at realistic, complex conditions. Additional explainability methods like SHAP and Grad-CAM enable a window into model decision-making, which can inform experimental design.

    abstract = {Imaging informatics approaches have played a significant role in gynecologic cytology since the introduction of BD FocalPoint and the ThinPrep Imaging System at the dawn of the new millennium. Although rudimentary compared to modern artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) techniques, the development of these systems nearly 20 years ago led to increased diagnostic performance, with potential to address issues relating to speed, throughput and reliability of cytologic assessment. However, rather than ushering in an age of increasing automation and quantitative analysis, algorithmic advances in cytology (and pathology in general), stagnated for approximately a decade after its introduction. In the 2010’s, the advent of AlexNet, coupled with plummeting storage and GPU costs, open-source development environments and the marketing of affordable, high throughput digital slide scanners accelerated progress and interest in digital pathology AI/ML applications. While the widespread adoption of large-scale consortium level datasets (e.g., The Cancer Genome Atlas) spurred the development of AI/ML methods for surgical pathology, large-scale collection, and algorithmic modeling of cytology specimens has lagged behind due to the varied nature of cytology preparations and assessment. However, increasing attention has been paid to cytopathology with a commensurate increase in publications and commercial applications in this area. Still, the applications of AI/ML to cytopathology and the herculean effort to implement fully digital pathology services remain in its nascent stages. This review explores the current state of research and commercial development in digital cytopathology, with a focus on AI/ML technologies.},

    abstract = {Purpose
Patient information videos are excellent for conveying information on eye health. Language barriers lead to inaccessibility for ethnic minorities. So far, overcoming language barriers have been very expensive, but in this short communications paper, we share our experiences with an inexpensive generative artificial intelligence-based translation system for videos.
Design
Explorative study.
Methods
We developed a patient information video on a very common and broadly relevant issue: how to use eye drops. The original video was made in Danish. We used HeyGen (HeyGen, Los Angeles, California, USA) to translate the video into three categories according to distance from Danish according to comparative linguistics: highly related (English and German), remotely related (French and Polish), and no recognizable relationship (Arabic and Turkish). Ophthalmologists with high proficiency in Danish and each of these languages evaluated and commented on the accuracy of the translations.
Results
All translations resulted in a recognizable clone of the original individual with synchronized lip movements and understandable language. We observed certain inaccuracies in the translation, however, these differed across languages without a specific pattern. Inconsistencies in formal/informal pronouns were observed across languages. But overall, the general information was conveyed across all languages.
Conclusion
Modern generative artificial intelligence-based translation tools can help tearing down language barriers and improve accessibility of patient information videos in ophthalmology.},

These advancements have reverberated across a wide spectrum of applications, catalyzing transformative outcomes. However, in stark contrast, the field of digital rock analysis finds itself grappling with a conspicuous dearth of data, a challenge that casts a formidable shadow over the effective deployment of computer vision techniques for rock image analysis. In response to this pressing issue, this paper presents a pioneering methodology designed to surmount the hurdles posed by data limitation in the realm of digital rock analysis. At the core of this innovative approach lies the fusion of artificially generated digital rock images, created using a state-of-the-art diffusion model, with their authentic counterparts. This fusion is guided by the overarching objective of augmenting the efficacy of various digital rock analysis applications. This integration endeavors to bridge the gap between the limited available data and the substantial demands of the digital rock analysis domain. The practical significance and potential of this integrated approach are vividly demonstrated through a series of concrete implementations. These include, but are by no means limited to, enhancing image quality to facilitate clearer visualization of intricate rock structures and refining the estimation of petrophysical properties with increased accuracy.},

The primary research question focuses on the feasibility of learning advantageous microstructural features from stochastic microstructure samples to facilitate the generative design of periodic microstructures, resulting in unprecedented properties. Instead of relying on brainstorming-based, ad hoc design inspiration approaches, we propose an eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)-based framework to automatically learn critical features from the exceptional outliers (with respect to properties) in stochastic microstructure samples, enabling the generation of novel periodic microstructure patterns with superior properties. This framework is demonstrated on three benchmark cases: designing 2D cellular metamaterials to maximize stiffness in all directions, to maximize the Poisson’s ratio in all directions, and to minimize the thermal expansion ratio. The effectiveness of the design framework is validated by comparing its novel microstructure designs with known stochastic and periodic microstructure designs in terms of the properties of interest.},

    abstract = {Aims
The aim of this study is to use generative artificial intelligence to perform bibliometric analysis on abstracts published at European Resuscitation Council (ERC) annual scientific congress and define trends in ERC guidelines topics over the last decade.
Methods
In this bibliometric analysis, the WebHarvy software (SysNucleus, India) was used to download data from the Resuscitation journal's website through the technique of web scraping. Next, the Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (ChatGPT-4) application programming interface (Open AI, USA) was used to implement the multinomial classification of abstract titles following the ERC 2021 guidelines topics.
Results
From 2012 to 2022 a total of 2491 abstracts have been published at ERC congresses. Published abstracts ranged from 88 (in 2020) to 368 (in 2015). On average, the most common ERC guidelines topics were Adult basic life support (50.1%), followed by Adult advanced life support (41.5%), while Newborn resuscitation and support of transition of infants at birth (2.1%) was the least common topic. The findings also highlight that the Basic Life Support and Adult Advanced Life Support ERC guidelines topics have the strongest co-occurrence to all ERC guidelines topics, where the Newborn resuscitation and support of transition of infants at birth (2.1%; 52/2491) ERC guidelines topic has the weakest co-occurrence.
Conclusion
This study demonstrates the capabilities of generative artificial intelligence in the bibliometric analysis of abstract titles using the example of resuscitation medicine research over the last decade at ERC conferences using large language models.},

To provide an introduction to the uses of generative artificial intelligence (AI) and foundation models, including large language models, in the field of health technology assessment (HTA).
Methods
We reviewed applications of generative AI in 3 areas: systematic literature reviews, real-world evidence, and health economic modeling.
Results
(1) Literature reviews: generative AI has the potential to assist in automating aspects of systematic literature reviews by proposing search terms, screening abstracts, extracting data, and generating code for meta-analyses; (2) real-world evidence: generative AI can facilitate automating processes and analyze large collections of real-world data, including unstructured clinical notes and imaging; (3) health economic modeling: generative AI can aid in the development of health economic models, from conceptualization to validation. Limitations in the use of foundation models and large language models include challenges surrounding their scientific rigor and reliability, the potential for bias, implications for equity, as well as nontrivial concerns regarding adherence to regulatory and ethical standards, particularly in terms of data privacy and security. Additionally, we survey the current policy landscape and provide suggestions for HTA agencies on responsibly integrating generative AI into their workflows, emphasizing the importance of human oversight and the fast-evolving nature of these tools.
Conclusions
Although generative AI technology holds promise with respect to HTA applications, it is still undergoing rapid developments and improvements. Continued careful evaluation of their applications to HTA is required.

    abstract = {Introduction
Feedback is at the core of competency-based medical education. Learner perceptions of the evaluation process influence how feedback is utilized. Systems emphasize a fixed mindset, prioritizing evaluation over growth. Embracing growth mindset culture, the belief that ability is acquired through effort and human capabilities can be developed over time, will allow learners to gain greater benefits from feedback. Transitioning from fixed mindset language (FML) to growth mindset language (GML) will require faculty training. Artificial intelligence (AI) can assist faculty with incorporating GML concepts in written feedback. The aim of this study was to assess the ability of AI to assist in changing FML feedback statements into statements with GML.
Methods
A qualitative study was performed utilizing a sample of 83 summative and formative feedback statements provided to students (37) and residents (46) from surgery clerkship and national SIMPL-inguinal hernia evaluations. Of these 83 statements, a reviewer coded 41 statements as using GML and 42 using FML. Original statements identified as using FML were entered into the Google Chrome "Help me write" tool, a writing aid using Generative AI. The AI tool was prompted with the statement "rewrite using growth mindset language:," followed by an original FML statement. A dataset containing a combination of AI-altered and original statements, 99 statements in all, was provided to two additional blinded reviewers trained in GML concepts. Reviewers evaluated statements as predominantly GML or FML and commented on their perception of AI use in statements. Reviewer agreement was adjudicated by the original coder.
Results
Of the 41 original GML statements, coders correctly identified 37 (90.2%) as using GML. Of the 26 original FML statements, coders correctly identified all 26 (100%) as using FML. Of the AI-modified FML to GML statements, coders correctly identified 17 of 18 (94.4%) as using GML. They correctly identified 56.3% as AI-modified and 44.8% as not AI-modified statements. They disagreed on AI use in 39.4% of statements. AI-assistance was unrecognized in 16 (8.1%) statements and mistaken for use in 47 (23.7%) statements.
Conclusions
AI was successful at modifying FML statements into feedback containing GML, and in a way that was not obviously AI-generated. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates that AI can be a helpful tool for faculty to increase the use of GML in written feedback. While AI cannot perfectly create GML feedback without initial input and understanding from faculty, it does serve as a promising educational aid. As the body of work on using GML in surgical education grows, the better AI can assist in the generation of quality feedback.},

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming speech-language pathology (SLP) and dysphagia management, offering innovative solutions for assessment, diagnosis, and rehabilitation. This narrative review examines AI applications in these fields from 2014 to 2024, with particular focus on implementation challenges in Latin America. We analyze key AI technologies—including deep learning, machine learning algorithms, and natural language processing—that have demonstrated high accuracy in detecting voice disorders, analyzing swallowing function, and supporting personalized rehabilitation. The review identifies three primary domains of AI application: diagnostic tools with improved sensitivity for speech-language disorders, rehabilitation technologies that enable customized therapy, and telehealth platforms that expand access to specialized care in underserved regions. However, significant barriers persist, particularly in Latin America, where limited infrastructure, insufficient linguistic adaptation, and scarce regional datasets hamper widespread implementation. Our pilot study evaluating commercially available large language models for rehabilitation planning demonstrates their potential utility in generating structured therapy activities, especially in resource-constrained settings. While AI shows promise in enhancing clinical workflows and expanding service delivery, the evidence suggests that current applications remain predominantly focused on diagnosis rather than integrated rehabilitation. This review highlights the need for culturally and linguistically adapted AI models, expanded regional research collaborations, and regulatory frameworks that ensure ethical AI integration into SLP and dysphagia care, positioning these technologies as complementary tools that enhance rather than replace clinical expertise.},

This study investigates whether and how AI Policy Uncertainty (AIPU) drives corporate greenwashing. Using a large panel of Chinese listed firms from 2010–Q1 2025 and a novel text-based index of AIPU, we establish a causal link through a multi-pronged identification strategy that includes Propensity Score Matching (PSM), a multi-period Difference-in-Differences (DID) design, and an Instrumental Variable (IV) analysis. We find robust evidence that AIPU significantly increases corporate greenwashing. Crucially, this effect is attenuated for firms led by CEOs with strong IT backgrounds, who can better navigate technological turbulence. We further unveil the micro-foundations of this effect, showing that AIPU fuels greenwashing through three distinct mediating pathways: splitting managerial attention toward external risks (a cognitive channel), increasing precautionary cash holdings (a financial channel), and directly inhibiting substantive green innovation (a strategic channel). Heterogeneity analysis also shows the effect is more pronounced for non-state-owned enterprises and non-high-tech firms. Our findings reveal an important unintended consequence of technology governance and offer crucial insights for managers, investors, and policymakers.},

This study investigates the influence of AI-based technologies on creating safe and respectful work atmospheres, focusing on their role in fostering safety, inclusion, and ethical management practices. Drawing on recent findings, the paper explores the dual nature of AI's effects, from enabling safer workplaces to posing ethical challenges. (1) The study identifies critical dynamics within AI-driven work environments. Through safety-oriented tools,—such as real-time risk monitoring systems,—AI contributes to incident prevention and fosters inclusion. However, its implementation also introduces challenges, particularly regarding privacy concerns and lack of transparency, which may trigger distrust and raise ethical dilemmas among employees. (2) The analysis further emphasizes ethical and operational barriers. To ensure effective integration, organisations must address the psychological impact of automation, ensuring it does not compromise employee morale or workplace cohesion. Transparent implementation practices are essential to avoid unintended negative consequences. (3) Findings reveal opportunities for AI to reshape organisational culture by harmonising operational efficiency with inclusive values. The study underscores the importance of aligning technological innovation with strategies that prioritise ethical governance and employee well-being. To support these insights, the study adopts a bibliographic analysis methodology, reviewing a curated corpus of peer-reviewed publications from the past five years. Sources were selected based on thematic relevance, scientific rigour, and empirical depth. This method enabled the identification of conceptual patterns, gaps in the literature, and key trends regarding the socio-ethical implications of AI in the workplace. These insights offer practical guidelines for organisations implementing AI technologies. By adopting transparent communication, ethical frameworks, and strategies aligned with employee well-being, businesses can leverage AI to create safer and more inclusive environments. This research underscores the importance of designing policies that balance technological advancement with respect for employee rights and privacy.},

Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) offers increased accessibility and personalized learning, though the potential for inaccuracies, biases, and unethical use is concerning. We present a newly developed research paper assignment that required students to utilize GAI. The assignment was implemented within three online, asynchronous graduate courses for medical laboratory sciences. Student learning was assessed using a rubric, which rated students’ effective integration and evaluation of GAI-generated content against peer-reviewed research articles, thus demonstrating their critical thinking and synthesis skills, among other metrics. Overall rubric scores were high, suggesting that learning outcomes were met. After field testing, we administered a 16-item survey about GAI utilization, contribution to learning, and ethical concerns. Data (n = 32) were analyzed, and free-response answers were thematically coded. While 93.8% of respondents found the GAI-generated content to be “very good” or “excellent,” 28.1% found inaccuracies, and 68.8% “strongly agreed” or “agreed” that GAI should be allowed to be used as a tool to complete academic assignments. Interestingly, however, only 28.1% “strongly agreed” or “agreed” that GAI may be used for assignments if not explicitly authorized by the instructor. Though GAI allowed for more efficient completion of the project and better understanding of the topic, students noted concerns about academic integrity and the lack of citations in GAI responses. The assignment can easily be modified for different learning preferences and course environments. Raising awareness among students and faculty about the ethical use and limitations of GAI is crucial in today’s evolving pedagogical landscape.},

In order to overcome the limitations of traditional journal cover design and enhance the artistic quality and communicative effectiveness of journal covers, this study proposes a method for designing international scientific journal covers driven by artificial intelligence. The method integrates numerous generative artificial intelligence technologies and multi-criteria decision-making methods, applying them to the design practice of food science journals, thereby improving the efficiency of journal cover design and publication. The integrated method first uses the coding method of grounded theory to extract five design dimensions critical to journal cover design and constructs a triple-mapping relationship model of technological translatability, visual expressiveness, and alignment with public cognition and cultural background, providing a research foundation for organizing design elements to align with the journal’s positioning. The DeepSeek large language model is employed to generate creative keywords for the journal cover, which are then translated into descriptive instructions recognizable by Midjourney. Subsequently, Midjourney is used to generate preliminary cover sketches to quickly visualise the creative concept, and the controlnet function of Stable Diffusion is employed to control the outline of the sketch’s line art, followed by experimentation and optimisation across dimensions such as visual style and tonal range. Finally, the VIKOR method is applied to evaluate and rank the six generated cover design proposals. The evaluation criteria encompass scientific content expression, visual aesthetics, and communication and acceptance, across three dimensions with fifteen indicators. The selected design proposals are then subjected to collaborative optimisation between human input and artificial intelligence. The integrated method offers a systematic and innovative framework, enhancing the efficiency, creativity, and visual impact of journal cover design, and provides both theoretical and practical references for future academic publishing.},

Pulmonary nodules are critical indicators for the early detection of lung cancer; however, their diagnosis and management pose significant challenges due to the variability in nodule characteristics, reader fatigue, and limited clinical expertise, often leading to diagnostic errors. The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) presents promising solutions to address these issues.
Methods:
This review compares traditional rule-based methods, handcrafted feature-based machine learning, radiomics, deep learning, and hybrid models incorporating Transformers or attention mechanisms. It systematically compares their methodologies, clinical applications (diagnosis, treatment, prognosis), and dataset usage to evaluate performance, applicability, and limitations in pulmonary nodule management.
Results:
AI advances have significantly improved pulmonary nodule management, with transformer-based models achieving leading accuracy in segmentation, classification, and subtyping. The fusion of multimodal imaging CT, PET, and MRI further enhances diagnostic precision. Additionally, AI aids treatment planning and prognosis prediction by integrating radiomics with clinical data. Despite these advances, challenges remain, including domain shift, high computational demands, limited interpretability, and variability across multi-center datasets.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly recognized as a vital tool in overcoming these challenges by enabling adaptive, cross-scale modeling and optimization across the entire cellular agriculture pipeline.
Scope and approach
This review synthesizes the application of AI across cellular agriculture, from molecular engineering and culture media optimization to real-time bioreactor monitoring and sensory prediction. We highlight how AI-driven technologies, including machine learning models, reinforcement learning, and digital twin systems, provide solutions to scalability issues, improve product quality, and enhance production efficiency. We also explore the integration of multimodal data streams to address cross-scale challenges, providing a novel framework for AI in cellular agriculture systems.
Key findings and significance
AI applications in cellular agriculture are revolutionizing the field by shifting it from empirical, trial-and-error approaches to intelligent, data-driven systems. AI is not only enabling precision in the optimization of growth conditions, tissue formation, and sensory properties but also fostering predictive, scalable, and customizable food production solutions. We discuss the challenges of data standardization, model interpretability, and cross-modal integration and propose future strategies to establish robust, explainable AI systems for next-generation food production.},

These include tools for extracting geometry from IFC models, algorithms for geometric enrichment, ontologies for rule-based model verification, machine learning techniques for space classification, external libraries, and IFC extensions for property addition to models. The integration of AI demonstrates significant potential to improve BIM-BEPS workflows, particularly in automating geometry extraction from BIM, enriching model data, and detecting inconsistencies in IFC models. The study also explores opportunities to enhance the BIM-BEPS workflow through IFC4 and future IFC generations, focusing on combining ontology frameworks with machine learning. Furthermore, the study emphasizes the industry’s role in developing better user support solutions, underscoring the need for users to adhere to well-defined design requirements and workflows to maximize the benefits of these advancements.},

    abstract = {Objective
Artificial intelligence (AI) shows promise in surgery, but its role in plastic surgery education remains underexplored. This review evaluates the current landscape of AI in plastic surgery education.
Design
A systematic search was conducted on August 11, 2024, across PubMed, CINAHL, IEEE, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar using terms related to AI, plastic surgery, and education. Original research articles focusing on AI in plastic surgery education were included, excluding correspondence, reviews, book chapters, theses, corrections, and non–peer-reviewed or non-English articles. Two investigators independently screened studies and synthesized data. ROBINS-I was used to assess bias.
Results
Fifteen studies were included, with 13 evaluating large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, Microsoft Bing, and Google Bard. ChatGPT-4 outperformed other models on In-Service Examinations (average score of 72.7%) and demonstrated potential as a teaching assistant in plastic surgery education. AI-generated personal statements were comparable to human-written ones. However, ChatGPT showed inaccuracies in generating surgical protocols. ChatGPT demonstrated its ability to provide qualitative predictions, forecasting survey results that indicated limited current use of AI in plastic surgery education but support for further AI research. a study combined ChatGPT with DALL-E 2, a generative model, to create acceptable educational images. Machine learning was used in 1 study for evaluating surgical skill and providing real-time feedback during liposuction. Nine studies had low risk of bias, while 6 had moderate risk.
Conclusions
AI demonstrates potential as an educational tool in plastic surgery. However, limitations of evidence, such as AI model uncertainties, introduce ambiguity. While AI cannot replicate the expertise of seasoned surgeons, it shows promise for foundational learning and skill assessment. Developing authenticity guidelines and enhancing AI capabilities are essential for its effective, ethical integration into plastic surgery education.},

    abstract = {Objective
To assess the current state of artificial intelligence (AI) policies, educational resources, and perceptions within U.S. plastic surgery residency programs from the perspectives of program directors (PDs) and residents.
Design
Cross-sectional study using 2 anonymized surveys to evaluate AI-related policies, current use, educational tools, perceived barriers, and attitudes toward AI use in surgical education and residency applications.
Setting
Plastic surgery residency programs across the United States
Participants
Program directors (n = 77) were invited via email, with 24 (31%) responding. Residents (n = 89) were recruited via social media; 1 resident per program was randomly selected to ensure institutional diversity, with 23 (26%) completing the survey.
Results
Institutional adoption of AI was limited. Only 8% of PDs reported screening residency applications for AI-generated content, and 88% indicated their programs had no formal policies on AI use. AI-based educational tools were available in 13% of programs, 21% offered AI ethics training, and 8% reported using AI to assess surgical skill. Barriers included lack of expertise (65%), data privacy concerns (52%), cost (48%), and limited evidence of efficacy (48%). In contrast, residents reported substantial independent AI use (50%). Residents used platforms such as ChatGPT (50%), Google Gemini, Microsoft Copilot, and Claude (each 9%)—often to generate clinical explanations (43%), procedural guides (17%), and differential diagnoses (13%). One resident also reported undergoing AI-based surgical skill assessment. Despite this engagement, 74% stated their programs lacked AI-related educational resources. Residents expressed moderate trust in AI (mean 5.26/10), stating it “probably” or “definitely” has a place in their education (86%).
Conclusions
A marked discrepancy exists between institutional policies and resident usage of AI in plastic surgery education. As residents adopt these tools independently, there is an urgent need for evidence-based guidelines, validated resources, and structured implementation to ensure safe, effective integration into surgical training.},

    abstract = {Summary
In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a powerful tool in healthcare and is becoming increasingly prevalent across all medical and paramedical disciplines. AI has numerous applications in pharmacology. This narrative review explores the increasing importance of AI in three key areas of pharmacology: pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and pharmacovigilance (PV), as well as pharmacology education. We conducted a literature review enhanced by the ARTIREV hybrid bibliometric tool to identify and analyze key advances, applications, and challenges with AI integration in this field. In PK, machine learning and hybrid approaches improve the prediction of individualized drug exposure, support model-informed precision dosing and handle irregular and sparse data through architectures such as recurrent neural networks and NeuralODEs. In PD, AI facilitates a shift towards an era of precision and personalized medicine by enabling the development of drug effect models and considering inter-individual variability. It also makes it easier to implement adaptive dosing regimens that are tailored to various constraints. Regarding PV, AI enhances the detection of adverse drug reactions, the identification of safety signals at the population level and the assessment of preclinical toxicities through the analysis of unstructured data, particularly from electronic health records. Despite their potential, AI models face several significant limitations. These include the quality of training data, limited explainability due to the “black box” effect and a lack of external validation of the models developed. Altogether, this review emphasizes the role of AI in pharmacology and the necessity of training future professionals to ensure the safe and validated use of AI in personalized medical applications.},

@article{GHANBARI2025101901,
    abstract = {Background
Exercise cardiovascular magnetic resonance (Ex-CMR) can reveal pathophysiologies not evident at rest by quantifying biventricular volume and function during or immediately after exercise. However, achieving reproducible Ex-CMR measurements is challenging due to limited spatial and temporal resolution. This study aimed to develop and evaluate a free-breathing, high-spatiotemporal-resolution single-beat Ex-CMR cine enhanced by generative artificial intelligence. We assessed image analysis reproducibility, scan-rescan reproducibility, and impact of the reader's experience on the analysis.
Methods
Imaging was performed on a 3T CMR system using a free-breathing, highly accelerated, multi-slice, single-beat cine sequence (in-plane spatiotemporal resolution of 1.9 × 1.9 mm² and 37 ms, respectively). High acceleration was achieved by combining compressed sensing reconstruction with a resolution-enhancement generative adversarial inline neural network. Ex-CMR was performed using a supine ergometer positioned immediately outside the magnet bore. Single-beat cine images were acquired at rest and immediately post-exercise. In a prospective study, the protocol was evaluated in 141 subjects. A structured image analysis workflow was implemented. Four expert readers, with or without prior training in single-beat Ex-CMR, independently rated all images for diagnostic and image quality. The subjective assessment used two 3-point Likert scales. Biventricular parameters were calculated. Inter- and intra-observer reproducibility were assessed. Fifteen healthy subjects were re-imaged 1 year later for scan-rescan reproducibility. Reproducibility was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), with agreement evaluated via Bland-Altman analysis, linear regression, and Pearson correlation.
Results
Free-breathing, single-beat Ex-CMR cine enabled imaging of the beating heart within 30 ± 6 s, with technically successful scans in 96% (136/141) of subjects. Post-exercise single-beat cine images were assessed as diagnostic in 98% (133/136), 96% (131/136), 82% (112/136), and 65% (89/136) of cases by four readers (ordered by descending years of Ex-CMR experience). Good image quality was reported in 74% (100/136) to 80% (109/136) of subjects. Biventricular parameters were successfully measured in all subjects, demonstrating good to excellent inter-observer reproducibility. Scan/rescan reproducibility over 1 year, assessed by two independent readers, showed excellent inter-visit ICCs (0.96–1.0) and strong correlations (R² ≥ 0.92, p < 0.001 for left ventricle; R² ≥ 0.95, p < 0.001 for right ventricle).
Conclusion
Single-beat Ex-CMR enabled evaluation of biventricular volumetric and functional indices with excellent reproducibility.},

This added complexity to the workflow but allowed for more precise and reproducible treatment. As a result, these advances required the accurate delineation of many more volumes, raising questions about how to delineate them, in a uniform manner across centers. Then, as computing power improved, reverse planning became possible and three-dimensional dose distributions could be generated. Artificial intelligence offers the opportunity to make such workflow more efficient while increasing practice homogeneity. Many artificial intelligence-based tools are being implemented in routine practice to increase efficiency, reduce workload and improve homogeneity of treatments. Data retrieved from this workflow could be combined with clinical data and omic data to develop predictive tools to support clinical decision-making process. Such predictive tools are at the stage of proof-of-concept and need to be explainatory, prospectively validated, and based on large and multicenter cohorts. Nevertheless, they could bridge the gap to personalized radiation oncology, by personalizing oncologic strategies, dose prescriptions to tumor volumes and dose constraints to organs at risk.},

To this end, we extend the Shapley–Lorenz method, normalised by construction, to Artificial Intelligence for time series, such as neural networks and recurrent neural networks. We illustrate the application of our proposal to a time series of Bitcoin prices, which acts as the response variable, along with time series of classical financial prices, which act as explanatory variables. Three main findings emerge from the analysis. First, recurrent neural networks lead to a better performance, in terms of accuracy and robustness, with respect to classic neural networks. Second, the best performing models indicate that Bitcoin prices are affected mostly by their lagged values, and that their explainability, in terms of classical financial assets, is limited. Third, although limited, the contribution of classical assets to Bitcoin price prediction is well captured by recurrent neural networks.},

There is a strong short- and medium-term decline in the intensity of searches for vacancies, indicating a notable reduction in the supply of young people actively seeking apprenticeships and suggesting great uncertainty among the affected cohort. Occupations with a high proportion of cognitive tasks and with high demands on language skills were particularly affected by the decline. Interestingly, the revealed preferences in the search behavior of young job seekers contrasted with previous expert assessments on the automation risks of occupations and aligned with the most recent assessments of the AI and language model exposure of occupations – before these new assessments existed. Notably, while the supply decline did not reduce the number of signed apprenticeship contracts, we find evidence of declining applicant quality, particularly for commercial employees, the most widely offered apprenticeship in Switzerland.},

Our findings reveal that technology-driven, organization-driven, environment-driven, and human-driven factors of AI positively influence students' dynamic capabilities—sensing, seizing, and reconfiguring—which subsequently enhance their AI-enabled marketing performance. Organizational flexibility emerges as a significant positive moderator in this relationship. The fsQCA analysis identifies six configurations leading to optimal marketing performance, providing nuanced insights for curriculum design. These findings contribute to management education literature by demonstrating how AI integration can enhance entrepreneurial learning outcomes and inform pedagogical approaches.

    abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a theoretical framework and systematic development of computational models designed to execute tasks that traditionally require human cognition. In medical imaging, AI is used for various modalities, such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound, and pathologies across multiple organ systems. However, integrating AI into medical ultrasound presents unique challenges compared to modalities like CT and MRI due to its operator-dependent nature and inherent variability in the image acquisition process. AI application to ultrasound holds the potential to mitigate multiple variabilities, recalibrate interpretative consistency, and uncover diagnostic patterns that may be difficult for humans to detect. Progress has led to significant innovation in medical ultrasound-based AI applications, facilitating their adoption in various clinical settings and for multiple diseases. This manuscript primarily aims to provide a concise yet comprehensive exploration of current and emerging AI applications in medical ultrasound within abdominal, musculoskeletal, and obstetric & gynecological and interventional medical ultrasound. The secondary aim is to discuss present limitations and potential challenges such technological implementations may encounter.},

    abstract = {Purpose
Through a systematic content analysis, this paper aims to examine the current use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the services of the top 100 US university libraries and explores the key factors that influence the adoption of this technology. It seeks to provide actionable strategic recommendations for library administrators. These recommendations aim to help libraries accelerate their intelligent service transformation while maintaining their academic resource advantages and humanistic traditions, and to establish a solid theoretical and empirical foundation for future research.
Design/methodology/approach
The authors analyse the current status of libraries adopting AI technologies and applying them to patron services, which include intelligent retrieval services, intelligent reference services, intelligent guided tour services and intelligent ID recognition services, among others. Firstly, the authors visit the official websites of the top 100 US university libraries to collect information. Subsequently, the prevalence of AI technologies is statistically analysed, and several excellent practice cases are selected. Finally, based on the data obtained from the content analysis, the impact of university rankings on the adoption of AI technologies in US university libraries is analysed.
Findings
The study finds that AI technologies are widely applied in the services of US university libraries, but there are differences in the adoption rates across different services. Almost all libraries have adopted intelligent retrieval and recommendation technology (99%). In terms of intelligent reference services, more than half of the libraries have used AI technologies (53%). Intelligent guided tour technology is also widely adopted (95%). The application of intelligent ID recognition technology in libraries is equally common (98%). Furthermore, more than half of the libraries have begun to explore generative AI technologies (61%). Additionally, the study further discovers that there is a significant negative correlation between university rankings and the number of AI technologies adopted by libraries. This indicates that top-ranked universities are more likely to introduce a variety of AI technologies in their library services.
Research limitations/implications
The study’s implications include constructing an analytical framework to assess AI in library services and identifying key adoption factors. It explores AI’s impact on service diversity and the popularity of different services. Notably, it finds a link between university rankings and AI adoption, offering insights into the relationship between tech adoption and institutional reputation.
Originality/value
This paper provides the latest statistical data on the use of AI technologies in US university libraries. It aims to help librarians understand the overall application situation and best practices. With these insights, librarians can develop corresponding plans to better use AI to serve patrons.},

We argue that this narcissistic blow has a potentially dramatic influence on perceptions of human society, interrelationships, and the self. We should, accordingly, expect dramatic changes in perceptions of the therapeutic act following the emergence of what we term the artificial third in the field of psychotherapy. The introduction of an artificial third marks a critical juncture, prompting us to ask the following important core questions that address two basic elements of critical thinking, namely, transparency and autonomy: (1) What is this new artificial presence in therapy relationships? (2) How does it reshape our perception of ourselves and our interpersonal dynamics? and (3) What remains of the irreplaceable human elements at the core of therapy? Given the ethical implications that arise from these questions, this paper proposes that the artificial third can be a valuable asset when applied with insight and ethical consideration, enhancing but not replacing the human touch in therapy.},

    abstract = {Background
The potential of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) to promote mental health is of great interest. Specifically, there is growing interest in integrating applied GenAI into psychotherapy or into the teacher/parent-child relationship. This paper describes CanvasHero, a GenAI tool that was developed following the devastating attacks on Israel in October 2023. It aims to promote resilience in children and adolescents who were evacuated from their homes due to the war. CanvasHero serves as a proof of concept for integrating GenAI as an additional element that can enrich and deepen interpersonal interaction.
Tool description
CanvasHero utilizes the BASIC Ph model and 6-Part Story Method for assessing and bolstering coping skills, aided by the interactive scaffolding and synthetic abilities of the GenAI. Key stages comprise (1) collaborative narrative construction between child, meaningful adult, and the GAI; (2) analysis of resilience themes; and (3) generative visualization representing the child's story through DALL-E's imaging capabilities.
Implementation protocol
The CanvasHero is optimally designed for children ages 7–16 under adult supervision, with the HEART Checklist developed to structure this process. Sessions typically occur remotely via videoconference, or in person.
Intended outcomes
CanvasHero aims to create a playful space for processing stress and trauma, identifies resilience resources, and strengthens these capabilities. At the same time, risks in GenAI integration are mitigated via human oversight and an ethics-focused design.
Conclusion
CanvasHero exemplifies a GenAI application that can assist during wartime, serving as a psycho-educational mediator and facilitating an imaginative and playful space between children and meaningful adults. Further studies are required to evaluate effectiveness and potential risks.},

Innovative teaching approaches will be employed for the broad spectrum of students; integrating AI across all levels of Bloom's processes-from production, comprehension, application, clinical case scenario harbingers, dynamic information delivery, and interactive teaching. Mixed-method design comprising both the quantitative (survey based analysis) and the qualitative (far-reaching theoretical framework and case studies review) methodologies was used in the current study. A structured survey was administered to collect data on the AI pattern, efficacy, and frequency of usage among 181 health sciences students. Case studies in practice were also used to serve as evidence of AI's role in medical training: from clinician-initiated simulations to AI-powered assessment tools. The data analysis approaches included descriptive statistics, correlation heat maps, and comparative analysis between AI-assisted teaching and standard teaching. It is concluded that such engagement of the use of AI makes for engagement and deep learning but requires strong institution-wide foundations and ethical frameworks, and measures of growth against institutional preparedness and of having a very rich ethical framework for risk management are still lacking. Hence, the study recommends that balancing technology with ethics would be needed in AI integration and proposes future studies to address gaps in teacher training, institution preparedness, and ethical consideration.},

After introducing essential AI techniques, it analyzes their role in various microgrid domains, such as design, control, and maintenance. (1) In the design realm, the focus is on optimal sizing. (2) In the realm of control, a hierarchical framework comprising primary, secondary, and tertiary levels is introduced. Within the tertiary control level, the focus is directed toward energy management systems. (3) Maintenance involves activities such as condition monitoring, diagnosis, and prognosis. In this context, focusing on power quality (PQ) issues underscores the role of AI in fault detection and classification as an integral part of the diagnostic process. Finally, the paper explores cutting-edge technologies and future advancements in microgrids. It highlights the integration of IoT for improved connectivity and data exchange, emphasizes the role of federated learning and blockchain in bolstering cybersecurity, and explores the transformative potential of digital twins in optimizing microgrid operations.},

    abstract = {Background
Artificial intelligence (AI) has shown promise in transforming health care, particularly in cardiology. However, there is a lack of high-quality evidence demonstrating its impact on crucial clinical outcomes.
Objectives
The purpose of this study was to synthesize existing evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the application of AI in cardiology, evaluating its impact on key clinical outcomes.
Methods
We conducted a systematic review following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, searching MEDLINE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library from inception to November 2024. We included RCTs evaluating machine learning models compared to traditional methods in cardiovascular care. Primary outcomes focused on patient-important metrics, while secondary outcomes covered time and resource savings.
Results
Eleven RCTs met the inclusion criteria. Studies were conducted between 2021 and 2024, with 81.2% being multicenter trials. Five studies (45.5%) reported improvements in clinical events, 6 (54.5%) showed enhanced diagnostic accuracy and early detection, and 3 (27.3%) demonstrated improved resource utilization.
Conclusions
This review highlights AI's potential to enhance cardiovascular care through improved early detection, diagnostic accuracy, and resource efficiency. However, the limited number of RCTs indicates a need for more high-quality studies to validate AI’s effectiveness across various clinical domains.},

Traditional design methods often focus on reconstructing functional motifs, but they face challenges in stabilizing structure and reproducing function. In this study, we aimed to develop a design method for small proteins using ProtGPT2, a model that generates protein sequences based on function and structure. First, amino acid sequence data of malate dehydrogenase (MDH) was collected, and ProtGPT2 was fine-tuned (ProtGPT2 for MDH). The chain length and perplexity (ppl) of the generated sequences were evaluated, producing shorter sequences than the natural ones. The validity of the generated sequences was assessed using both population and individual analyses. Population analysis, including multiple sequence alignment (MSA) and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE), revealed that ProtGPT2 for MDH identified functional motifs of MDH and incorporated them into the generated sequences. Additionally, tSNE showed that the generated sequences were highly similar to natural MDH sequences. In individual analysis, 10 randomly selected sequences were evaluated using BLAST, AlphaFold2, and InterPro. BLAST indicated that 9 sequences were novel MDH variants. AlphaFold2 confirmed that their 3D structures were highly similar to known MDH structures. InterPro identified domains and active sites in 2 sequences, suggesting that they were novel, small MDH variants. In conclusion, ProtGPT2 for MDH has the potential to design amino acid sequence candidates for small MDHs. The validity and utility of the model will be established through future experimental efforts.},

    abstract = {Purpose
To evaluate the performance of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based artificial intelligence (AI) in the preoperative prediction of microvascular invasion (MVI) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
Methods
A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science was conducted up to May 2025, following PRISMA guidelines. Studies using MRI-based AI models with histopathologically confirmed MVI were included. Study quality was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tool and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework. Statistical synthesis used bivariate random-effects models.
Results
Twenty-nine studies were included, totaling 2838 internal and 1161 external validation cases. Pooled internal validation showed a sensitivity of 0.81 (95% CI: 0.76–0.85), specificity of 0.82 (95% CI: 0.78–0.85), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) of 19.33 (95% CI: 13.15–28.42), and area under the curve (AUC) of 0.88 (95% CI: 0.85–0.91). External validation yielded a comparable AUC of 0.85. Traditional machine learning methods achieved higher sensitivity than deep learning approaches in both internal and external validation cohorts (both P < 0.05). Studies incorporating both radiomics and clinical features demonstrated superior sensitivity and specificity compared to radiomics-only models (P < 0.01).
Conclusions
MRI-based AI demonstrates high performance for preoperative prediction of MVI in HCC, particularly for MRI-based models that combine multimodal imaging and clinical variables. However, substantial heterogeneity and low GRADE levels may affect the strength of the evidence, highlighting the need for methodological standardization and multicenter prospective validation to ensure clinical applicability.},

    abstract = {The rapid expansion of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) has transformed various industries, giving rise to an array of GAI products. However, inconsistent product quality complicates user decisions, jeopardizing both the sustainability of GAI technologies and their broader adoption. To address these challenges, this study proposes a user-centered evaluation framework that integrates fuzzy social networks with advanced multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) approaches. Grounded theory is first employed to establish a ''marketing-information-product-individual'' system of factors influencing GAI product adoption. Next, fuzzy social networks reduce semantic ambiguity and mitigate expert bias, while the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) method uncovers causal relationships among these factors. The DEMATEL-based Analytic Network Process (DANP) then quantifies the relative importance of each factor, followed by a modified VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) method to comprehensively evaluate representative GAI products. The findings reveal that product maturity exerts the strongest driving force, whereas perceived effect experiences the highest overall impact. Information reliability and the individual dimension carry the greatest weights. Moreover, current products display notable deficiencies in risk management, user service, and ease of use, all of which warrant developers' attention to enhance user satisfaction and adoption. In light of these results, the study proposes targeted optimization strategies for four distinct GAI products. By integrating fuzzy social networks and MADM methodologies, this framework offers a rigorous, systematic evaluation tool that significantly improves decision-making accuracy and promotes the sustainable development of GAI applications.},

Objective
Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming musculoskeletal research, offering new approaches to diagnosis, prognosis, and patient management in osteoarthritis (OA). However, implementation and ethical challenges persist. This manuscript summarizes insights from the OARSI 2025 Pre-Congress Workshop on Artificial Intelligence in Osteoarthritis Research, highlighting opportunities and challenges in applying AI across biomechanics, imaging, and clinical research domains.
Design
The workshop, organized by the OARSI Early Career Investigator Committee and co-chaired by Drs. Matthew Harkey and Brooke Patterson, convened experts to discuss the use of AI in real-world biomechanics data collection, radiomics for imaging-based biomarkers, and large language models (LLMs) for clinical and research applications. Emphasis was placed on the need for interdisciplinary collaboration and ethical oversight.
Results
In biomechanics, AI-driven markerless motion capture and wearable sensors enable scalable, ecologically valid data collection, though issues such as class imbalance, data privacy, and model interpretability remain. In imaging, radiomics and deep learning models show promise for early OA detection and progression prediction but face challenges in domain adaptation and external validation. In clinical research, LLMs can streamline documentation and thematic analysis but must address concerns around bias, data security, and transparency. Across domains, transparency, reproducibility, and ethical use of AI were emphasized as critical for maintaining scientific rigor.
Conclusions
Cross-disciplinary collaboration and AI literacy are essential to responsibly advance AI integration in OA research. The workshop’s collective insights call for ethical, patient-centered approaches that leverage AI’s strengths while preserving research integrity and trust.},

    abstract = {Abstract
Artificial intelligence (AI) is a colossal buzzword, a confusing subject matter, but also an inevitable reality. Generative and nongenerative AI are the 2 core subtypes of AI. Generative AI uses current data to understand patterns and generate new information, and it is especially valuable in producing synthetic medical images, enhancing surgical simulations, and expanding training datasets. Techniques such as generative adversarial networks (GANs), large language models (LLMs), and variational autoencoders (VAEs) allow for the creation of realistic simulations, text, and models that can be used for perioperative communication and planning. Conversely, nongenerative AI is centered on the examination and categorization of pre-existing data to formulate predictions or decisions—the most popular denomination namely machine learning. This approach is instrumental in tasks such as forecasting surgical outcomes, segmenting medical images, and determining patient risk profiles. Models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), random forests, and support vector machines (SVMs) are widely used for these purposes, demonstrating high accuracy and reliability in clinical decision making. Although generative AI offers innovative tools for creating new data and simulations, nongenerative AI excels in analyzing existing data to inform patient care. Both approaches have the potential of supporting clinical workflows to automate redundancies and improve efficiencies. However, there are also limitations in the application of AI in orthopaedics, including the potential for bias in models, the challenge of interpreting AI-driven insights, and the ethics of oversight. As the integration of AI in orthopaedics continues to grow, it is essential for practitioners to understand these technologies' capabilities and limitations to harness their full potential and establish appropriate governance.},

    abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (AI) may revolutionize health care, providing solutions that range from enhancing diagnostic accuracy to personalizing treatment plans. However, its rapid and largely unregulated integration into medicine raises ethical concerns related to data integrity, patient safety, and appropriate oversight. One of the primary ethical challenges lies in generative AI’s potential to produce misleading or fabricated information, posing risks of misdiagnosis or inappropriate treatment recommendations, which underscore the necessity for robust physician oversight. Transparency also remains a critical concern, as the closed-source nature of many large-language models prevents both patients and health care providers from understanding the reasoning behind AI-generated outputs, potentially eroding trust. The lack of regulatory approval for AI as a medical device, combined with concerns around the security of patient-derived data and AI-generated synthetic data, further complicates its safe integration into clinical workflows. Furthermore, synthetic datasets generated by AI, although valuable for augmenting research in areas with scarce data, complicate questions of data ownership, patient consent, and scientific validity. In addition, generative AI’s ability to streamline administrative tasks risks depersonalizing care, further distancing providers from patients. These challenges compound the deeper issues plaguing the health care system, including the emphasis of volume and speed over value and expertise. The use of generative AI in medicine brings about mass scaling of synthetic information, thereby necessitating careful adoption to protect patient care and medical advancement. Given these considerations, generative AI applications warrant regulatory and critical scrutiny. Key starting points include establishing strict standards for data security and transparency, implementing oversight akin to institutional review boards to govern data usage, and developing interdisciplinary guidelines that involve developers, clinicians, and ethicists. By addressing these concerns, we can better align generative AI adoption with the core foundations of humanistic health care, preserving patient safety, autonomy, and trust while harnessing AI’s transformative potential.

However, explainability is a major challenge due to sub-symbolic techniques like Deep Neural Networks and Ensembles, which were absent during the boom of AI. The practical application of AI in numerous application areas is greatly undermined by this lack of explainability. In order to counter the lack of perception of AI-based systems, Explainable AI (XAI) aims to increase transparency and human comprehension of black-box AI models. Explainable AI (XAI) also strives to promote transparency and human comprehension of black-box AI models.

    abstract = {Purpose
We compare human intelligence to artificial intelligence (AI) in the choice of appropriate Journal of Economic Literature (JEL) codes for research papers in economics.
Design/methodology/approach
We compare the JEL code choices related to articles published in the recent issues of the Journal of Economic Literature and the American Economic Review and compare these to the original JEL code choices of the authors in earlier working paper versions and JEL codes recommended by various generative AI systems (OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Microsoft’s Copilot, Google’s Gemini) based on the abstracts of the articles.
Findings
There are significant discrepancies and often limited overlap between authors’ choices of JEL codes, editors’ choices as well as the choices by contemporary widely used AI systems. However, the observations suggest that generative AI can augment human intelligence in the micro-task of choosing the JEL codes and, thus, save researchers time.
Research limitations/implications
Rapid development of AI systems makes the findings quickly obsolete.
Practical implications
AI systems may economize on classification costs and (semi-)automate the choice of JEL codes by recommending the most appropriate ones. Future studies may apply the presented approach to analyze whether the JEL code choices between authors, editors and AI systems converge and become more consistent as humans increasingly interact with AI systems.
Originality/value
We assume that the choice of JEL codes is a micro-task in which boundedly rational decision-makers rather satisfice than optimize. This exploratory experiment is among the first to compare human intelligence and generative AI in choosing and justifying the choice of optimal JEL codes.},

    abstract = {Products and services labeled as AI-created are perceived differently than identical ones attributed to humans, reflecting the phenomenon of algorithm aversion. This perception gap is partly explained by individuals’ tendency to attribute lower effort and creativity to work produced by AI algorithms. Through two pre-registered experiments, we investigate how individuals evaluate creative content when it is labeled as created by AI, humans, or human-AI collaboration. While previous research has established algorithm aversion across various domains, our findings reveal nuanced patterns in creative contexts. Individuals consistently rate content labeled as AI-authored as less creative and less favorable compared to content labeled as human-authored. This effect is driven by a sequential mediation: perceived effort influences perceived creativity, which in turn shapes overall attitudes. Importantly, content labeled as human-AI collaboration performs significantly better than AI-only content, suggesting a potential mitigation strategy. Our main theoretical contribution is the identification of the machine heuristic (MH), individuals' preexisting beliefs about AI capabilities, as a key moderator. Individuals with stronger MH beliefs attribute more effort to AI-generated work, which positively influences perceptions of creativity along with behavioral intentions. Using Netflix show descriptions as stimuli, we show these effects extend beyond attitudes to impact behavioral outcomes like willingness to watch. These results expand algorithm aversion theory by establishing MH as an important boundary condition and highlighting human-AI collaboration as an effective mitigation approach, offering valuable insights for creative industries integrating AI while maintaining positive perceptions among users.},

While the first AI-powered negotiation solutions are currently being used by procurement professionals to negotiate for non-critical spend items, which is an example of structural influence, the behavioral influence of AI-based chatbots (i.e., on negotiation approach) remains unknown. It is unclear in which behavioral settings these chatbots deliver value to the buying firm in terms of economic, psychological, and relational outcomes. To fill this gap, we conduct three experiments in buyer–supplier negotiation settings, two in a lab-setting with undergraduate business students and one online experiment with professional negotiators. In our interactive simulations, participants play the role of the supplier, while a ChatGPT-based custom-trained chatbot acts as the buyer. We find that when the chatbot deploys a competitive, as compared to a collaborative, negotiation approach, it will achieve a higher price discount, better payment terms, and a quicker negotiation. However, suppliers trust a collaboratively prompted, as compared to a competitively prompted, chatbot more and demonstrate higher outcome satisfaction, as well as a stronger desire for future interaction. A text analysis of the chat interactions indicates a higher level of similarity when a competitively prompted chatbot is employed, which implies that suppliers also use more insistent and intimidating language, thereby matching the chatbot's negotiation approach to a greater degree. While the negotiation approach is a significant influencing factor, we do not find significant evidence that item type, in our case non-critical or bottleneck, matters, which indicates that AI-based chatbots can be effective in various buyer–supplier settings.},

The declaration process leaves room for over- and under-declaration, which entails risks for organizations. This paper focuses on the question of how generative artificial intelligence can be used to assess the standard-essentiality of 5G technology patents. For this purpose, the standard-essentiality is assessed using different prompts with four Large Language Models (LLMs) in two variants. In the first variant, the LLM results are generated by a rather simple prompt and compared with an approach based on unsupervised and supervised machine learning. The result shows that large LLMs are capable of assessing the standard-essentiality. In the second variant, the best-performing LLM is selected and the prompt is expanded to include selected parts of a technical standard. While the assessment results remain largely the same, the LLM is now able to explain in which detail a patent is part of a standard.

    abstract = {Background
The medical interview remains a cornerstone of clinical training. There is growing interest in applying generative artificial intelligence (AI) in medical education, including medical interview training. However, its utility in culturally and linguistically specific contexts, including Japanese, remains underexplored. This study investigated the utility of generative AI for Japanese medical interview training.
Objective
This pilot study aimed to evaluate the utility of generative AI as a tool for medical interview training by comparing its performance with that of traditional face-to-face training methods using a simulated patient.
Methods
We conducted a randomized crossover pilot study involving 20 postgraduate year 1‐2 physicians from a university hospital. Participants were randomly allocated into 2 groups. Group A began with an AI-based station on a case involving abdominal pain, followed by a traditional station with a standardized patient presenting chest pain. Group B followed the reverse order, starting with the traditional station for abdominal pain and subsequently within the AI-based station for the chest pain scenario. In the AI-based stations, participants interacted with a GPT-configured platform that simulated patient behaviors. GPTs are customizable versions of ChatGPT adapted for specific purposes. The traditional stations involved face-to-face interviews with a simulated patient. Both groups used identical, standardized case scenarios to ensure uniformity. Two independent evaluators, blinded to the study conditions, assessed participants’ performances using 6 defined metrics: patient care and communication, history taking, physical examination, accuracy and clarity of transcription, clinical reasoning, and patient management. A 6-point Likert scale was used for scoring. The discrepancy between the evaluators was resolved through discussion. To ensure cultural and linguistic authenticity, all interviews and evaluations were conducted in Japanese.
Results
AI-based stations scored lower across most categories, particularly in patient care and communication, than traditional stations (4.48 vs 4.95; P=.009). However, AI-based stations demonstrated comparable performance in clinical reasoning, with a nonsignificant difference (4.43 vs 4.85; P=.10).
Conclusions
The comparable performance of generative AI in clinical reasoning highlights its potential as a complementary tool in medical interview training. One of its main advantages lies in enabling self-learning, allowing trainees to independently practice interviews without the need for simulated patients. Nonetheless, the lower scores in patient care and communication underline the importance of maintaining traditional methods that capture the nuances of human interaction. These findings support the adoption of hybrid training models that combine generative AI with conventional approaches to enhance the overall effectiveness of medical interview training in Japan.

This narrative review explores AI integration across various diagnostic domains, emphasizing its role in improving clinical decision-making. The evolution of medical diagnostics from traditional observational methods to sophisticated imaging, laboratory tests, and molecular diagnostics lays the foundation for understanding AI’s impact. Modern diagnostics are inherently complex, influenced by multifactorial disease presentations, patient variability, cognitive biases, and systemic factors like data overload and interdisciplinary collaboration. AI-enhanced clinical decision support systems utilize both knowledge-based and non-knowledge-based approaches, employing machine learning and deep learning algorithms to analyze vast datasets, identify patterns, and generate accurate differential diagnoses. AI’s potential in diagnostics is demonstrated through applications in genomics, predictive analytics, and early disease detection, with successful case studies in oncology, radiology, pathology, ophthalmology, dermatology, gastroenterology, and psychiatry. These applications demonstrate AI’s ability to process complex medical data, facilitate early intervention, and extend specialized care to underserved populations. However, integrating AI into diagnostics faces significant limitations, including technical challenges related to data quality and system integration, regulatory hurdles, ethical concerns about transparency and bias, and risks of misinformation and overreliance. Addressing these challenges requires robust regulatory frameworks, ethical guidelines, and continuous advancements in AI technology.

As AI continues to grow, it will be crucial for healthcare providers and our community as hepatologists to understand the implications and impact of this growth and what this means for our practice and patients. We draw from existing AI frameworks, principles of medical ethics, as well as quality healthcare principles to propose our framework for AI in hepatology. Our proposed framework includes patient-centered care, non-maleficence and safety, equity, transparency, accountability, and security and privacy. For each of these topics, we discuss examples relevant to hepatology. We also propose an action plan for hepatologists on how each of these principles can be upheld in our day-to-day practice. While many hepatology specific AI applications are currently being tested in research studies, they have not yet made it to “prime time.” As a result, the hepatology community has time to consider governance structures to put in place in preparation for the inherent challenges that come with AI implementation and integration into clinical care to ensure that care is responsible, ethical, safe, and secure. With careful and conscientious planning, the inclusion of relevant stakeholders, and laying the groundwork for governance, AI can improve quality of health care in hepatology with efficiency, improved safety, and equity.},

    abstract = {Objective
This meta-analysis evaluates the diagnostic accuracy of computed tomography (CT)-based artificial intelligence (AI) in detecting lymph node metastasis in rectal cancer patients.
Methods
A thorough literature search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science to identify studies on the diagnostic accuracy of CT-based AI in detecting lymph node metastasis in rectal cancer patients, with a deadline of September 2024. The analysis assessed the performance of AI algorithms in detection through CT imaging. Pooled sensitivity and specificity were calculated using a bivariate random-effects model, reported with 95% confidence intervals. Study heterogeneity was evaluated using the I2 statistic to account for heterogeneity among the included studies.
Results
Seven studies were included in this meta-analysis. The internal test set contained 23 contingency tables, while the radiologists' data included 19 contingency tables. AI’s pooled sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) were 0.84 (0.79–0.87), 0.77 (0.66–0.85), and 0.88 (0.16–1.00), respectively. Radiologists had pooled sensitivity, specificity, and AUC of 0.80 (0.72–0.86), 0.54 (0.46–0.63), and 0.72 (0.11–0.98). Funnel plot analysis showed P values of 0.13 for AI and 0.40 for radiologists, indicating that no publication bias was observed.
Conclusions
CT-based AI demonstrates superior specificity over radiologists for LNM detection in rectal cancer, However, significant heterogeneity across studies and limited external test of existing models warrant further multicenter test studies before clinical implementation.},

    abstract = {Rapid urbanization, alongside escalating resource depletion and ecological degradation, underscores the critical need for innovative urban development solutions. In response, sustainable smart cities are increasingly turning to cutting-edge technologies—such as Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), Foundation Models (FMs), and Urban Digital Twin (UDT) frameworks—to transform urban planning and design practices. These transformative tools provide advanced capabilities to analyze complex urban systems, optimize resource management, and enable evidence-based decision-making. Despite recent progress, research on integrating GenAI and FMs into UDT frameworks remains scant, leaving gaps in our ability to capture complex urban flows and multimodal dynamics essential to achieving environmental sustainability goals. Moreover, the lack of a robust theoretical foundation and real-world operationalization of these tools hampers comprehensive modeling and practical adoption. This study introduces a pioneering Large Flow Model (LFM), grounded in a robust foundational framework and designed with GenAI capabilities. It is specifically tailored for integration into UDT systems to enhance predictive analytics, adaptive learning, and complex data management functionalities. To validate its applicability and relevance, the Blue City Project in Lausanne City is examined as a case study, showcasing the ability of the LFM to effectively model and analyze urban flows—namely mobility, goods, energy, waste, materials, and biodiversity—critical to advancing environmental sustainability. This study highlights how the LFM addresses the spatial challenges inherent in current UDT frameworks. The LFM demonstrates its novelty in comprehensive urban modeling and analysis by completing impartial city data, estimating flow data in new locations, predicting the evolution of flow data, and offering a holistic understanding of urban dynamics and their interconnections. The model enhances decision-making processes, supports evidence-based planning and design, fosters integrated development strategies, and enables the development of more efficient, resilient, and sustainable urban environments. This research advances both the theoretical and practical dimensions of AI-driven, environmentally sustainable urban development by operationalizing GenAI and FMs within UDT frameworks. It provides sophisticated tools and valuable insights for urban planners, designers, policymakers, and researchers to address the complexities of modern cities and accelerate the transition towards sustainable urban futures.},

Existing GT performance modeling methods have relatively poor generalization and adaptability under different operating conditions and different units. This paper proposes a generative artificial intelligence (AI) embedded thermodynamic modeling method of GTs for adaptive performance matching. Possible component performance curves are automatically generated by the variational autoencoder in the shape view. Speed-dependent map sampling coefficients of the curves are introduced to realize fast matching of various operating conditions. The proposed method is verified on 2 different types of in-service GTs in the industrial field with mean absolute percentage error 0.5% and 0.54%, respectively. The maximum reduction of performance prediction error is 2.37% compared to traditional methods. The proposed method can realize high-precision GT performance adaptive prediction with good generalization and applicability, thus providing guidance for high efficiency operation control and health management. This paper shows an interpretable and reliable approach for the integration of AI with thermodynamics.

    abstract = {Purpose
The integration of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) into scientific research and academic writing has generated considerable controversy. Currently, standards for using GAI in academic medicine remain undefined. This study aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the guidance provided for authors regarding the use of GAI in ophthalmology scientific journals.
Design
Cross-sectional bibliometric analysis.
Participants
A total of 140 ophthalmology journals listed in the Scimago Journal and Country Rankings, regardless of language or origin.
Methods
We systematically searched and screened the 140 ophthalmology journals’ websites on October 19 and 20, 2024, and conducted updates on November 19 and 20, 2024.
Main Outcome Measures
The content of GAI guidelines from the websites of the 140 ophthalmology journals.
Results
Of 140 journals reviewed, 96 (69%) provide explicit guidelines for authors regarding the use of GAI. Among these, nearly all journals agree on 3 key points: (1) 94 journals (98%) have established specific guidelines prohibiting GAI from being listed as an author; (2) 94 journals (98%) emphasize that human authors are responsible for the outputs generated by GAI tools; and (3) all 96 journals require authors to disclose any use of GAI. In addition, 20 journals (21%) specify that their guidelines pertain solely to the writing process with GAI. Furthermore, 92 journals (66%) have developed guidelines concerning GAI-generated images, with 63 journals (68%) permitting their use and 29 (32%) prohibiting them. Among those that prohibit GAI images, 27 journals (93%) allow their use under specific conditions.
Conclusion
Although there is considerable ethical consensus among ophthalmology journals regarding the use of GAI, notable variations exist in terms of permissible use and disclosure practices. Establishing standardized guidelines is essential to safeguard the originality and integrity of scientific research. Researchers must uphold high standards of academic ethics and integrity when using GAI.},

    abstract = {ABSTRACT
Artificial intelligence (AI) generative models driven by the integration of AI and natural language processing technologies, such as OpenAI’s chatbot generative pre-trained transformer large language model (LLM), are receiving much public attention and have the potential to transform personalized medicine. Dialysis patients are highly dependent on technology and their treatment generates a challenging large volume of data that has to be analyzed for knowledge extraction. We argue that, by integrating the data acquired from hemodialysis treatments with the powerful conversational capabilities of LLMs, nephrologists could personalize treatments adapted to patients’ lifestyles and preferences. We also argue that this new conversational AI integrated with a personalized patient-computer interface will enhance patients’ engagement and self-care by providing them with a more personalized experience. However, generative AI models require continuous and accurate updates of data, and expert supervision and must address potential biases and limitations. Dialysis patients can also benefit from other new emerging technologies such as Digital Twins with which patients’ care can also be addressed from a personalized medicine perspective. In this paper, we will revise LLMs potential strengths in terms of their contribution to personalized medicine, and, in particular, their potential impact, and limitations in nephrology. Nephrologists’ collaboration with AI academia and companies, to develop algorithms and models that are more transparent, understandable, and trustworthy, will be crucial for the next generation of dialysis patients. The combination of technology, patient-specific data, and AI should contribute to create a more personalized and interactive dialysis process, improving patients’ quality of life.

These findings are particularly important given that many of these interventions are brief and self-administered, making them both accessible and scalable for large populations. However, the efficacy of positive psychology interventions is often constrained by small effect sizes. In light of advancements in generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), this study explored whether integrating AI chatbots into positive psychology interventions could enhance their efficacy compared to traditional self-administered approaches. Study 1 examined the efficacy of a gratitude intervention delivered through Snapchat's My AI, while Study 2 evaluated a self-affirmation intervention integrated with a customized ChatGPT. Both studies employed within-subject experimental designs. Contrary to our hypotheses, the integration of AI did not yield incremental improvements in gratitude outcomes (Study 1), or self-view outcomes (Study 2) compared to existing non-AI interventions. However, exploratory analyses revealed that the AI-integrated self-affirmation intervention significantly enhanced life satisfaction and medium-arousal positive affect, suggesting potential benefits for selected well-being outcomes. These findings indicate that while AI integration in brief, self-administered positive psychology interventions may enhance certain outcomes, its suitability varies across intervention types. Further research is needed to better understand the contexts in which AI can effectively augment positive psychology interventions.},

Data from 531 AI image creators supported our hypotheses, revealing that: (1) integration effort significantly enhances both compatibility and synergy; (2) compatibility positively influences synergy; (3) synergy directly and positively impacts user value creation; and (4) synergy serves as a critical mediator in the relationships between the two enablers—compatibility and integration effort—and user value creation, with compatibility also partially mediating the link between integration effort and synergy. These results extend systems theory by integrating it more deeply with the resource-based view and highlighting synergy as a pivotal factor that not only directly drives user value creation but also mediates the effects of compatibility and integration effort. Furthermore, the study empirically confirms that user value can be conceptualized through three key constructs: efficiency, effectiveness, and innovation.},

    abstract = {The explosive growth of data traffic and heterogeneous service requirements of 5G networks—covering Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB), Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communication (URLLC), and Massive Machine Type Communication (mMTC)—present tremendous challenges to conventional methods of bandwidth allocation. A new deep reinforcement learning-based (DRL-based) bandwidth allocation system for real-time, dynamic management of 5G radio access networks is proposed in this paper. Unlike rule-based and static strategies, the proposed system dynamically updates itself according to shifting network conditions such as traffic load and channel conditions to maximize the achievable throughput, fairness, and compliance with QoS requirements. By using extensive simulations mimicking real-world 5G scenarios, the proposed DRL model outperforms current baselines like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), linear regression, round-robin, and greedy algorithms. It attains 90%–95% of the maximum theoretical achievable throughput and nearly twice the conventional equal allocation. It is also shown to react well under delay and reliability constraints, outperforming round-robin (hindered by excessive delay and packet loss) and proving to be more efficient than greedy approaches. In conclusion, the efficiency of DRL in optimizing the allocation of bandwidth is highlighted, and its potential to realize self-optimizing, Artificial Intelligence-assisted (AI-assisted) resource management in 5G as well as upcoming 6G networks is revealed.},

    abstract = {Background
Interest has recently increased in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), a subset of artificial intelligence that can create new content. Although the publicly available GenAI tools are not specifically trained in the medical domain, they have demonstrated proficiency in a wide range of medical assessments. The future integration of GenAI in medicine remains unknown. However, the rapid availability of GenAI with a chat interface and the potential risks and benefits are the focus of great interest. As with any significant medical advancement or change, medical schools must adapt their curricula to equip students with the skills necessary to become successful physicians. Furthermore, medical schools must ensure that faculty members have the skills to harness these new opportunities to increase their effectiveness as educators. How medical schools currently fulfill their responsibilities is unclear. Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine (COMs) in the United States currently train a significant proportion of the total number of medical students. These COMs are in academic settings ranging from large public research universities to small private institutions. Therefore, studying COMs will offer a representative sample of the current GenAI integration in medical education.
Objective
This study aims to describe the policies and training regarding the specific aspect of GenAI in US COMs, targeting students, faculty, and administrators.
Methods
Web-based surveys were sent to deans and Student Government Association (SGA) presidents of the main campuses of fully accredited US COMs. The dean survey included questions regarding current and planned policies and training related to GenAI for students, faculty, and administrators. The SGA president survey included only those questions related to current student policies and training.
Results
Responses were received from 81% (26/32) of COMs surveyed. This included 47% (15/32) of the deans and 50% (16/32) of the SGA presidents (with 5 COMs represented by both the deans and the SGA presidents). Most COMs did not have a policy on the student use of GenAI, as reported by the dean (14/15, 93%) and the SGA president (14/16, 88%). Of the COMs with no policy, 79% (11/14) had no formal plans for policy development. Only 1 COM had training for students, which focused entirely on the ethics of using GenAI. Most COMs had no formal plans to provide mandatory (11/14, 79%) or elective (11/15, 73%) training. No COM had GenAI policies for faculty or administrators. Eighty percent had no formal plans for policy development. Furthermore, 33.3% (5/15) of COMs had faculty or administrator GenAI training. Except for examination question development, there was no training to increase faculty or administrator capabilities and efficiency or to decrease their workload.
Conclusions
The survey revealed that most COMs lack GenAI policies and training for students, faculty, and administrators. The few institutions with policies or training were extremely limited in scope. Most institutions without current training or policies had no formal plans for development. The lack of current policies and training initiatives suggests inadequate preparedness for integrating GenAI into the medical school environment, therefore, relegating the responsibility for ethical guidance and training to the individual COM member.},

Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools have experienced rapid development over the last decade and are gaining increasing popularity as assistive models in academic writing. However, the ability of AI to generate reliable and accurate research articles is a topic of debate. Major scientific journals have issued policies regarding the contribution of AI tools in scientific writing.
Methods
We conducted a review of the author and peer reviewer guidelines of the top 25 Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine journals as per the 2023 SCImago rankings. Data were obtained though reviewing journal websites and directly emailing the editorial office. Descriptive data regarding journal characteristics were coded on SPSS. Subgroup analyses of the journal guidelines were conducted based on the publishing company policies.
Results
Our analysis revealed that all scientific journals in our study permitted the documented use of AI in scientific writing with certain limitations as per ICMJE recommendations. We found that AI tools cannot be included in the authorship or be used for image generation, and that all authors are required to assume full responsibility of their submitted and published work. The use of generative AI tools in the peer review process is strictly prohibited.
Conclusion
Guidelines regarding the use of generative AI in scientific writing are standardized, detailed, and unanimously followed by all journals in our study according to the recommendations set forth by international forums. It is imperative to ensure that these policies are carefully followed and updated to maintain scientific integrity.},

    abstract = {Background
Resident training programs in the US use the Orthopaedic In-Training Examination (OITE) developed by the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) to assess the current knowledge of their residents and to identify the residents at risk of failing the Amerian Board of Orthopaedic Surgery (ABOS) examination. Optimal strategies for OITE preparation are constantly being explored. There may be a role for Large Language Models (LLMs) in orthopaedic resident education. ChatGPT, an LLM launched in late 2022 has demonstrated the ability to produce accurate, detailed answers, potentially enabling it to aid in medical education and clinical decision-making. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance of ChatGPT on Orthopaedic In-Training Examinations using Self-Assessment Exams from the AAOS database and approved literature as a proxy for the Orthopaedic Board Examination.
Methods
301 SAE questions from the AAOS database and associated AAOS literature were input into ChatGPT's interface in a question and multiple-choice format and the answers were then analyzed to determine which answer choice was selected. A new chat was used for every question. All answers were recorded, categorized, and compared to the answer given by the OITE and SAE exams, noting whether the answer was right or wrong.
Results
Of the 301 questions asked, ChatGPT was able to correctly answer 183 (60.8%) of them. The subjects with the highest percentage of correct questions were basic science (81%), oncology (72.7%, shoulder and elbow (71.9%), and sports (71.4%). The questions were further subdivided into 3 groups: those about management, diagnosis, or knowledge recall. There were 86 management questions and 47 were correct (54.7%), 45 diagnosis questions with 32 correct (71.7%), and 168 knowledge recall questions with 102 correct (60.7%).
Conclusions
ChatGPT has the potential to provide orthopedic educators and trainees with accurate clinical conclusions for the majority of board-style questions, although its reasoning should be carefully analyzed for accuracy and clinical validity. As such, its usefulness in a clinical educational context is currently limited but rapidly evolving.
Clinical relevance
ChatGPT can access a multitude of medical data and may help provide accurate answers to clinical questions.},

    abstract = {Objectives
This study aimed to gain insights into the potential of using evidence from artificial intelligence (AI) in nursing support for clinical practice and decision-making and its implications for future studies.
Methods
This was a rapid review of the literature. The PubMed, CINAHL, and CENTRAL in the Cochrane Library databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on nursing support using AI for patient care, published between 2010 and 2024. The included studies were assessed for quality appraisal using the mixed methods appraisal tool, version 2018, and data extracted from each study were synthesized narratively considering the review questions.
Results
After removing duplicates, 5,176 studies were identified, resulting in the inclusion of 20 studies. The 20 studies were published between 2012 and 2024, with five studies focusing on “providing information and advice to patients using AI,” seven studies on “clinical decision-making support for nurses using predictive algorithms,” and eight studies on “psychosocial support using AI-equipped social robots.” In the qualitative appraisal of these studies, the proportion of studies that met the quality criteria for each item ranged from 35% to 85%.
Conclusions and Implications
In this review, we identified 20 RCTs that have been published so far on AI in nursing support, and currently, research is shifting from the development and testing phase to the implementation and effectiveness verification phase. However, many studies were found to be at risk of bias, suggesting caution when applying the evidence to clinical practice. Moving forward, there is a pressing need for the accumulation of high-quality RCTs and evidence integration through meta-analyses.
Brief summary
This study explored the potential of AI in nursing support, highlighting 20 published RCTs. Research in this field is transitioning from development and testing to implementation and effectiveness verification.},

Designing new products and artifacts is one of the many fields where it is very difficult to enable computing machines replicate human creativity and innovativeness. Design processes in engineering fields as well as in arts follow methodical series of steps to create new products. Due to high demands of customized products and services, competitors tend to shorten the time-to-market periods, using advanced Computer-Aided Design programs. These programs play important roles to assist designers in digitizing blueprints and automating repetitive tasks. However, they fail to boost designer creativity by generating or suggesting new ideas or designs based on existing products or their variants. In order to boost creativity in the entertainment industry, we propose in this paper a new approach based on unsupervised learning techniques to create variants of a given artifact or product blueprints. Within the field of designing new cartoon characters, our proposed approach relies on Generative Adversarial Neural Networks [1] to create new anime or cartoon faces on their own without any human intervention. It learns features and characteristics from an image training dataset and combines them to create new features and thus builds a new image which is not present in the training dataset. This applied approach attempts to not only help artists and designers to have a preview of the possible new and unique avatars but also would prevent any copyright infringements.},

This study addresses these challenges through a comprehensive framework that utilizes wearable devices for real-time lifestyle data collection and employs Wasserstein generative adversarial networks (WGANs) to address data imbalance concerns. The proposed framework incorporates an explainable model architecture combining tabular attention network (TabNet) with eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), complemented by SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis for enhanced interpretability. The framework was validated using data collected from 362 elementary school students over six months, with an additional external validation set of 82 students. The results demonstrated exceptional performance with 98.0% accuracy on the test dataset and 85.2% accuracy on the external validation data. Therefore, the framework can provide personalized health guidance by identifying and explaining individual factors that contribute to weight change, thereby enabling targeted intervention strategies for childhood obesity prevention.},

However, most existing studies estimate a singular land value over large areas, lacking the fine-grained details for urban management. This study therefore develops a RAHGV (relative-to-absolute hybrid generative valuation) framework for regional land valuation, which combines a hybrid learning strategy with deep generative modeling to produce high-resolution, spatially continuous land value distribution across extensive urban areas. In a case study of New York City (NYC), the RAHGV model outperforms typical one-step models by differentiating between local land variations and broader regional tendencies. Its bi-attention bottleneck significantly improves model performance, reducing MAE (Mean Absolute Error) by 45.75% and MSE (Mean Squared Error) by 69.86% compared to conventional deep generative methods. Local physical infrastructure and mixed land-use patterns primarily influence micro-scale land values, while community amenities and economic vibrancy drive macro-scale values. The findings highlight the potential of the RAHGV framework as a powerful tool for promoting sustainable urban development by delivering high-resolution, data-driven insights that support informed decision-making in rapidly evolving urban environments.},

Based on an experiment in a programming learning context, we find that although GenAI use significantly reduces learning cost, especially for less prepared learners, the cost reduction effect has not been translated into improved learning outcomes. We find no significant moderating effects of learning preparation on how GenAI use affects informational benefit and knowledge fit, further showing that GenAI tools have not yet been effectively utilized to help less prepared learners or reduce the educational divide.

    abstract = {This research employed metaphor analysis to explore 277 postgraduate students' perceptions of the role of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in academic writing. All participants were international students, from a total of 14 countries and regions, studying in the United Kingdom. Data collection was carried out in two phases. The first was a survey comprising demographic and metaphor-related questions, and the second involved metaphor checking, in which participants provided screenshots of their interactions with GenAI. The data, which were analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively, yielded 53 unique metaphors for the concept of GenAI in academic writing. We divided these into four conceptual categories in what we term the 4T Pyramid Model: Technical Support (representative metaphor: high-heeled shoes), Text Development (compass), Transformative Potential (Spider-Man), and Threat (drug). The respondents' academic disciplines influenced their perceptions of GenAI, but overall, the results suggest that most viewed it as transformative, i.e., more than just a writing tool. This study's innovative methodology integrating metaphor analysis with real user interactions offers a framework, aligned with Bloom's Taxonomy, that reveals the multi-level benefits and potential risks of GenAI. It also provides actionable insights for AI literacy education, including strategies for effective prompt design.},

While the uncanny abilities of Large Language Models to produce fluent text on almost any subject lends these ideas some plausibility, they are based on debatable, if not erroneous, claims about the capabilities of generative AI. Although rarely presented in these terms, these claims may be seen to reflect a limited, substantive conception of the agency of AI systems. Alternative conceptualisations of agency from other disciplines are presented that may offer potentially more fruitful ways of thinking about agency in relation to AI. The way that conceptions of the agency of AI systems is shaped by the language used to describe their behaviour is highlighted and opportunities for alternative conceptions of agency to inform a more critical analysis of generative AI are identified.},

This review explores key Generative AI models, including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), flow-based models and Transformer-based models, with Transformers gaining prominence due to the abundance of text-based biological data and the success of language models like ChatGPT. The paper discusses molecular representations, performance evaluation metrics, and current trends in Generative AI-driven drug discovery, such as protein-protein interactions (PPIs), drug-target interactions (DTIs) and de-novo drug design. However, these approaches face significant challenges, including applicability domain issues, lack of interpretability, data scarcity, novelty, scalability, computational resource limitations, and the absence of standardized evaluation metrics. These challenges hinder model performance, complicate decision-making, and limit the generation of novel and viable drug candidates. To address these issues, strategies such as hybrid models, integration of multiomics datasets, explainable AI (XAI) techniques, data augmentation, transfer learning, and cloud-based solutions are proposed. Additionally, a curated list of databases supporting drug discovery research is provided. The review concludes by emphasizing the need for optimized AI models, robust validation methods, interdisciplinary collaboration, and future academic efforts to fully realize the potential of Generative AI in advancing drug discovery.},

Concerns about the opacity of today's neural network AI solutions have led to the Explainable AI (XAI) project, which attempts to open the black box of neural networks. While XAI can help to partially interpret and explain the workings of neural networks, it has not changed their original subsymbolic nature and the opaque statistical nature of their workings. Significant uncertainties remain about the safety, reliability, and accountability of modern neural network AI solutions. Here we present a novel AI method that has a fully transparent white-box nature - eXplicitly eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XXAI). XXAI is implemented on deterministic cellular automata whose rules are based on first principles of the problem domain. XXAI overcomes the limitations for a broader application of symbolic AI. The practical value of XXAI lies in its ability to make autonomous, fully transparent decisions due to its multi-component, multi-level, networked, hyper-logical nature. Looking ahead, XXAI has the potential to become a leading strategic partner in the field of neuro-symbolic hybrid AI systems. XXAI is able to systematically validate neural network solutions, ensuring that the required standards of reliability, security and ethics are met throughout the AI lifecycle, from training to deployment. By creating a clear cognitive framework, XXAI will enable the development of advanced autonomous solutions to achieve the human-centric values of the future Industry 5.0.

    abstract = {The main drawback of traditional ecological models is the inability to model local interactions between individuals. As a consequence, it was impossible to mathematically model individual-based mechanisms of direct and indirect competition, which hampers the understanding of ecological dynamics. To overcome this problem, we developed a fully transparent mechanistic analog of the classical Lotka-Volterra phenomenological model based on explicitly explainable artificial intelligence (AI) of the glass-box type. In this paper, on an individual-based model, we present (i) a rigorous mechanism of inverted competitive exclusion where, all else being equal, the weaker species in direct competition defeats the stronger species through indirect exploitative competition and (ii) a rigorous mechanism of coexistence of complete competitors resulting from a combination of accounting for microhabitat regeneration, moderate reproduction, a certain habitat size and boundary conditions. Both presented mechanisms go beyond the classical formulations of the competitive exclusion principle, as in our model two species with different competitiveness compete for a single limiting resource in one homogeneous bounded ecosystem. We have shown that individual-based modeling of direct and indirect competition mechanisms allows for a more detailed understanding of the causal mechanisms of interspecific competition. Such understanding is necessary to refine formulations of the competitive exclusion principle, to search for mechanisms of competitive coexistence, to predict ecosystem behavior, and to develop conservation strategies. Our approach allows us to study discrete systems with fundamentally discrete mathematics, which opens up new opportunities for achieving accuracy, clarity, rigor, and explainability in studies of complex systems.},

    abstract = {Background
With the rapid development and iteration of generative artificial intelligence, the growing popularity of such groundbreaking tools among nurse researchers, represented by ChatGPT (OpenAI), is receiving passionate debate and intrigue. Although there has been qualitative research on generative artificial intelligence in other fields, little is known about the experiences and perceptions of nurse researchers; this study seeks to report on the topic.
Objective
This study aimed to describe the experiences and perceptions of generative artificial intelligence among Chinese nurse researchers, as well as provide a reference for the application of generative artificial intelligence in nursing research in the future.
Methods
Semistructured interviews were used to collect data in this qualitative study. Researchers mainly conducted interviews on the cognition, experience, and future expectations of nurse researchers regarding the use of generative artificial intelligence. Twenty-seven nurse researchers were included in the study. Through purposive sampling and snowball sampling, there were 7 nursing faculty researchers, 10 nursing graduate students, and 10 clinical nurse researchers. Data were analyzed using inductive content analysis.
Results
Five themes and 12 subthemes were categorized from 27 original interview documents as follows: (1) diverse reflections on human-machine symbiosis, which includes the interplay between substitution and assistance, researchers shaping the potential of generative artificial intelligence, and acceptance of generative artificial intelligence with alacrity; (2) multiple factors of the usage experience, including individual characteristics and various usage scenarios; (3) research paradigm reshaping in the infancy stage, which involves full-process groundbreaking assistive tools and emergence of new research paths; (4) application risks of generative artificial intelligence, including intrinsic limitations of generative artificial intelligence and academic integrity and medical ethics; and (5) the co-improvement of technology and literacy, which concerns reinforcement needs for generative artificial intelligence literacy, development of nursing research generative artificial intelligence and urgent need for artificial intelligence–generated content detection tools. In this context, the first 4 themes form the rocket of the human-machine symbiosis journey. Only when humans fully leverage the advantages of machines (generative artificial intelligence) and overcome their shortcomings can this human-machine symbiosis journey reach the correct future direction (fifth theme).
Conclusions
This study explored the experiences and perceptions of nurse researchers interacting with generative artificial intelligence, which was a “symbiotic journey” full of twists and turns, and provides a reference and basis for achieving harmonious coexistence between nurse researchers and generative artificial intelligence in the future. Nurse researchers, policy makers, and application developers can use the conclusions of this study to further promote the application of generative artificial intelligence in nursing research, policy making, and product development.},

This study aims to evaluate the performance of ScholarGPT, a Large Language Model (LLM) developed for academic purposes, on questions related to dental avulsion. In addition, to analyze and compare it with the results of the previous study evaluating the performance of ChatGPT and Gemini.
Method
A total of 22 technical questions (11 multiple-choice questions (MCQs), 11 true/false (T/F)) were posed to the ScholarGPT. ScholarGPT responses were assessed using a modified Global Quality Scale (GQS). Responses were randomized using an online randomizer (www.randomizer.org) before scoring. A single researcher carried out the assessments at three different times, two weeks apart, and a new randomization was performed before each scoring.
Results
When the answers given by ScholarGPT according to the question groups were analyzed by the Mann-Whitney U test, the mean value was found to be 4.64 for MCQ questions and 4.82 for T/F questions. ScholarGPT provided similarly high-quality and consistent answers in both question types (p = 0.590). When the performance of ScholarGPT was compared with Gemini and ChatGPT via the Friedman test, the mean score of ScholarGPT responses was significantly higher than both ChatGPT and Gemini (mean difference with Gemini = 0.75; mean difference with ChatGPT = 1.62, p < 0.001). ScholarGPT produced statistically significantly more consistent and higher-quality responses than ChatGPT and Gemini.
Conclusion
ScholarGPT showed high performance on technical questions related to dental avulsion and produced more consistent and higher-quality answers than ChatGPT and Gemini. According to the findings, LLMs based on academic databases can provide more accurate and reliable information. In the future, through the development of LLMs specific to the branches of dentistry, artificial intelligence systems can produce higher quality and consistent information.},

The study proposes that it isn't possible to harness the potential benefits of AI technologies unless students' concerns about these technologies are suitably addressed. Although the number of potential benefits specifically related to the use of AI in education is enormous, addressing students' concerns about AI is essential to ensure the effective use of these technologies in education. The correlational survey model was used in this study. Four well-established instruments were employed to collect data from students who studied in different public university faculties in Turkey. Participants were selected from students who had been using AI tools for educational purposes for at least six months. The findings showed that cognitive flexibility, digital competencies and self-regulation skills impact on AI anxiety. Students with high cognitive flexibility had lower AI anxiety, while students with high digital competencies were better able to comprehend and use AI technologies. In addition, students with high self-regulation skills were able to manage their own learning processes more effectively and experienced less anxiety in using AI. As a result, increasing university students' digital competencies and self-regulation skills can be influential in reducing their AI anxiety. Accordingly, educational institutions could offer programs to develop students' digital competencies and AI literacy. These programs can help them adapt to AI technologies more easily and reduce their anxiety about these technologies by teaching students how to use AI technologies effectively and efficiently.},

    abstract = {The development of generative artificial intelligence (genAI) has caused concern about its potential risks, including how its ability to generate human-like texts could affect our shared perception of the social world. Yet, it remains unclear how best to assess and understand genAI's influence on our understanding of social reality. Building on insights into the representation of social worlds within texts, we introduce a framework for analyzing genAI's content and its consequences for perceptions of social reality. We demonstrate this “synthetic duality” framework in two parts. First, we show that genAI can create, with minimal guidance, reasonable portrayals of actors and ascribe relational meaning to those actors – virtual social worlds within texts, or “Mondo-Breigers”. Second, we examine how these synthetic documents with interior social worlds affect readers’ view of social reality. We find that they change individuals’ perceptions of actors depicted in the documents, likely by updating individuals’ expectations about the actors and their meanings. However, additional exploratory analyses suggest it is texts’ style, not their construction of “Mondo-Breigers”, that might be influencing people's perceptions. We end with a discussion of theoretical and methodological implications, including how genAI may unsettle structural notions of individuality. Namely, reimagining the duality of individuals and groups could help theorize growing homogeneity in an increasingly genAI-informed world.},

    abstract = {Purpose
We compared the performance of generative artificial intelligence (AI) (Augmented Transformer Assisted Radiology Intelligence [ATARI, Microsoft Nuance, Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Washington]) and natural language processing (NLP) tools for identifying laterality errors in radiology reports and images.
Methods
We used an NLP-based (mPower, Microsoft Nuance) tool to identify radiology reports flagged for laterality errors in its Quality Assurance Dashboard. The NLP model detects and highlights laterality mismatches in radiology reports. From an initial pool of 1,124 radiology reports flagged by the NLP for laterality errors, we selected and evaluated 898 reports that encompassed radiography, CT, MRI, and ultrasound modalities to ensure comprehensive coverage. A radiologist reviewed each radiology report to assess if the flagged laterality errors were present (reporting error—true-positive) or absent (NLP error—false-positive). Next, we applied ATARI to 237 radiology reports and images with consecutive NLP true-positive (118 reports) and false-positive (119 reports) laterality errors. We estimated accuracy of NLP and generative AI tools to identify overall and modality-wise laterality errors.
Results
Among the 898 NLP-flagged laterality errors, 64% (574 of 898) had NLP errors and 36% (324 of 898) were reporting errors. The text query ATARI feature correctly identified the absence of laterality mismatch (NLP false-positives) with a 97.4% accuracy (115 of 118 reports; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 96.5%-98.3%). Combined vision and text query resulted in 98.3% accuracy (116 of 118 reports or images; 95% CI = 97.6%-99.0%), and query alone had a 98.3% accuracy (116 of 118 images; 95% CI = 97.6%-99.0%).
Conclusion
The generative AI-empowered ATARI prototype outperformed the assessed NLP tool for determining true and false laterality errors in radiology reports while enabling an image-based laterality determination. Underlying errors in ATARI text query in complex radiology reports emphasize the need for further improvement in the technology.},

    abstract = {The current and potential impact of various applications of artificial intelligence (AI) to the field of academic publishing in psychiatry is the subject of increasing attention. At present, AI algorithms assist in data analysis, allowing researchers to process large datasets quickly and uncover complex patterns that would be challenging to detect manually. In psychiatry, this capability can potentially help integrate data from genetics, neuroimaging, and clinical assessments. AI-driven natural language processing (NLP) tools might also facilitate systematic reviews and meta-analyses by automating the extraction and synthesis of information from vast bodies of published literature. In publishing, AI can potentially help to streamline the publication process in certain ways. Automated systems might screen manuscripts for methodological rigor, ethical compliance, and potential conflicts of interest, thereby reducing the burden on editors by prompting them to consider certain matters, and possibly accelerating the publication timeline. AI-powered tools are already used to help with dissemination of research findings by generating summaries and identifying key insights, making information more accessible to a broader audience. In the future, AI has the potential to enhance psychiatric publishing in various other ways. Predictive analytics might identify emerging trends and research gaps in the literature, guiding future studies and funding priorities, although this remains speculative for now. AI could also facilitate more robust collaborations by connecting researchers with complementary expertise and interests. Additionally, the integration of AI in digital platforms could democratise access to cutting-edge research, promote global knowledge sharing, and accelerate advancements in clinical care. As AI continues to evolve, its applications in research and publishing hold the potential to drive significant progress in understanding and treating mental disorders. It is essential that these developments are accompanied by openness about the use of AI in publishing, with clear declarations by authors and publishers about the use of specific applications in published work.},

However, during that transition, several significant problems and questions need to be addressed for the field to develop ethically, such as digital privacy, ownership, and control. These are some of the reasons why the currently most popular approaches of artificial intelligence, i.e., centralized artificial intelligence (CEAI), are questionable, with other directions also being explored widely, such as decentralized artificial intelligence (DEAI), which aim to solve some of the most far-reaching problems. This paper aims to review and organize the knowledge in the field of DEAI, focusing solely on studies that fall within this category. A systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted using six scientific databases and additional gray literature to analyze and present the findings of 71 identified studies. The paper’s primary focus is identifying the building blocks of DEAI solutions and networks, tackling the DEAI analysis from a bottom-up approach.

    abstract = {Background
Discrepancies in medical data sets can perpetuate bias, especially when training deep learning models, potentially leading to biased outcomes in clinical applications. Understanding these biases is crucial for the development of equitable healthcare technologies. This study employs generative deep learning technology to explore and understand radiographic differences based on race among patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty.
Methods
Utilizing a large institutional registry, we retrospectively analyzed pelvic radiographs from total hip arthroplasty patients, characterized by demographics and image features. Denoising diffusion probabilistic models generated radiographs conditioned on demographic and imaging characteristics. Fréchet Inception Distance assessed the generated image quality, showing the diversity and realism of the generated images. Sixty transition videos were generated that showed transforming White pelvises to their closest African American counterparts and vice versa while controlling for patients’ sex, age, and body mass index. Two expert surgeons and 2 radiologists carefully studied these videos to understand the systematic differences that are present in the 2 races’ radiographs.
Results
Our data set included 480,407 pelvic radiographs, with a predominance of White patients over African Americans. The generative denoising diffusion probabilistic model created high-quality images and reached an Fréchet Inception Distance of 6.8. Experts identified 6 characteristics differentiating races, including interacetabular distance, osteoarthritis degree, obturator foramina shape, femoral neck-shaft angle, pelvic ring shape, and femoral cortical thickness.
Conclusions
This study demonstrates the potential of generative models for understanding disparities in medical imaging data sets. By visualizing race-based differences, this method aids in identifying bias in downstream tasks, fostering the development of fairer healthcare practices.},

    abstract = {This study investigates how organizationally prescribed perfectionism (OPP) influences organizational innovation through the sequential mediating roles of psychological contract breach (PCB) and knowledge-hiding behavior (KHB), with artificial intelligence technology acceptance (AITA) demonstrating a moderating impact. Adopting a four-wave, time-lagged research design, data were gathered from 849 employed adults in South Korea, yielding 363 usable responses. The measurement model was evaluated using confirmatory factor analysis, which demonstrated the distinctiveness of the core constructs. Structural equation modeling assessed the hypothesized relationships and revealed that OPP had no direct effect on innovation; rather, its impact was mediated by PCB, which occurs when employees perceive the unyielding demands of an organization as violating mutual obligations, and subsequently by KHB, which refers to individuals withholding work-related information. This chain of unfavorable perceptions and behaviors ultimately diminishes organization-level innovation capacity. Furthermore, AITA functioned as a crucial buffer in the link between OPP and PCB, signifying that employees who were more receptive to AI tools were less likely to interpret perfectionistic standards as unfair. This study’s findings enhance the current theoretical discourse by highlighting a multi-level explanatory process that elucidates how externally imposed performance pressure erodes innovation potential.

    abstract = {Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have highlighted the potential of extensive battery cycle data for diagnosing performance degradation in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). Therefore, related generative models have been developed to rapidly generate a variety of battery data from a small number of real-world experimental measurements. This study proposes a physics-driven generative model (PGM) to produce realistic battery cycle data by reasonably sampling electrochemical parameters in a stochastic manner. PGM captured the fundamental principles of LIBs as electrochemical parameter distributions and then generated the corresponding virtual LIBs, even under conditions that have not been previously applied. This superior generalizable capability was validated by showing that PGM was very effective in detecting the internal short circuits (ISCs) of LIBs. Synthetic data with different ISC degree effects were generated using PGM based only on ISC-free LIBs. The results showed that a neural network trained on the generated synthetic data achieved a detection accuracy of 97.39 % for real physical ISCs, which was comparable to the detection results of a neural network trained using approximately 25 times more real data, including experimental results with ISCs. The proposed PGM is expected to contribute significantly to the rapid advancement of AI-based LIB diagnostics by generating physically meaningful data based on internal electrochemical principles.},

Instead of traditional imaging methods, electrical impedance signals were used to reconstruct cell images. A generative AI model with eight hidden layers processed 191 impedance values to accurately reconstruct the shapes of cancer cells and control beads. Our approach successfully reconstructed images of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, HeLa cells, and beads, achieving 91 % accuracy on the test dataset. Validation using the Structural Similarity Index (SSI) and Mean Structural Similarity Index (MSSIM) produced scores of 0.97 for breast cancer cells and 0.93 for beads, confirming the high precision of this method. This label-free, impedance-based imaging offers a promising solution for cancer diagnostics by accurately reconstructing cell shapes and distinguishing cell types, particularly in point-of-care applications.},

This study examines the acceptance of the use of GenAI tools for teaching and learning among primary and secondary school teachers in Hong Kong. It uses an extension of the technology acceptance model (TAM) with a modified framework that incorporates two key factors: self-efficacy and subjective norm. Data were collected from a sample of 367 primary and secondary school teachers in Hong Kong using questionnaires containing items for six constructs: self-efficacy, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, attitude towards using, subjective norm, and behavioural intention. The results show that fostering teachers' self-efficacy, perceived usefulness, and attitude is essential for successfully increasing their behavioural intention to use GenAI tools. Subjective norm was also found to influence teachers' behavioural intention. To enhance teachers' effective use of GenAI for teaching, teacher development programmes should focus on equipping teachers with comprehensive conceptual knowledge and skills and an understanding of the application of these tools to teaching and learning. Policy support to create a conducive environment for the use of GenAI in teaching and learning would also be beneficial. The study has theoretical implications in its extension of the TAM model as well as implications for enhancing teachers’ AI literacy and developing pedagogies for the meaningful use of GenAI tools for teaching and learning in K–12 settings.},

But the flourishing communication about AI makes it more difficult to understand what AI actually is and what role AI takes in society. From a systems theory perspective, we propose that to understand AI is to understand how societal subsystems deal with AI. To investigate the different constructions of AI we use text mining methods on the discursive structure, the semantics, and their trends over the past 20 years. We compare two subsystems – science and mass media – with getting insights from two databases – OpenAlex and Wikipedia. In science, AI is a computer science topic, consisting of four main strands: computer vision, natural language processing, robotics, and machine learning. AI as a research topic appears as a driver of scientific development that underlies machine learnization. AI as a media and broadcasting topic on Wikipedia is stable and concentrates on science, big technological firms, and science fiction. The respective pages are oriented towards the perspective of everyday life and range from personal assistance systems over sci-fi franchises to philosophical currents. We diagnose a trend from speculation to application in the attention AI receives on Wikipedia. Other systems like polity, law, or social movements do not play (at the moment) an important role in either system. Taken together, the trends point to a peculiar divergence between exaggerated expectations, everyday applications and societal debates about potentials, limits, and challenges.},

    abstract = {Abstract ID 126248 Poster Board 224 Purpose: The objective of this study is to establish the accuracy of generative artificial intelligence (AI) when scoring medical student exam questions in an open-ended format (OEQ) compared to a faculty content expert. Background: Despite the numerous benefits to including OEQs in assessment of medical knowledge1,2, only 39% of US allopathic medical schools use them3. Faculty report that the biggest barrier is the time it takes to grade student responses1,2. Natural language processing has been explored to automate scoring of clinical reasoning4, but no study has evaluated the use of generative AI to score OEQ responses in the pre-clerkship curriculum. Methods: OEQ responses from two questions administered at the Zucker School of Medicine (ZSOM) and the University of California at San Francisco School of Medicine (UCSF) were used for the current study5. Responses from 54 students per site were analyzed. Content experts scored the responses using an analytic (ZSOM) or holistic rubric (UCSF). Questions, rubrics, and student responses were fed into the GPT-4 model via the Med2Lab platform. Once finalized, scores for each student’s response were generated. Cohen’s weighted kappa (kw) was used to evaluate inter-rater reliability (IRR) between the content expert and generative AI scores, with kw scores between 0.60 and 0.80 being considered substantial6. Prompt engineering was employed for question 1 (analytic rubric) to evaluate its impact on IRR. Results: IRR between the content expert and generative AI scores was substantial using the analytic rubric (question 1: kw = 0.71; question 2: kw = 0.63) and the holistic rubric (question 1: kw = 0.66; question 2: kw = 0.68). IRR for question 1 (analytic rubric) was initially kw = 0.61 but was increased to kw = 0.71 after adjustments with prompt engineering and re-run in GPT-4. Conclusions: Generative AI can score OEQs with substantial reliability. With the potential to alleviate grading burden, AI scoring will allow medical schools to broadly implement OEQs for assessment.},

    abstract = {Background
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are transforming hemostasis and thrombosis care, with applications spanning disease detection, risk assessment, laboratory testing, patient education, personalized medicine, and drug development. This narrative review explores AI’s clinical utility and limitations across these 6 domains.
Methods
A comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, and Scopus (up to February 2025) was conducted using terms related to AI, thrombosis, and hemostasis. Peer-reviewed, English-language studies were included, supplemented by manual and reference screening. Of 84 studies included, 38 focused on risk assessment, 16 on diagnostics, and others on personalized medicine, drug development, and patient engagement.
Results
AI demonstrated high accuracy in diagnosing thrombotic events via imaging and electronic health record analysis, although sensitivity gaps persisted for complex cases. In laboratory settings, AI outperformed manual review in detecting errors (eg, sample mislabeling and clotted specimens). Risk stratification models surpassed traditional scores (eg, CHA2DS2-VASc) in predicting thromboembolism, yet inconsistently performed in cancer-associated thrombosis. Personalized anticoagulation dosing and genetic severity prediction in hemophilia highlighted AI’s precision. Chatbots and adherence tools have enhanced patient education while AI-driven drug discovery identified novel anticoagulants and repurposed existing therapies. Limitations included variable external validation, “black box” interpretability issues, and dataset biases.
Conclusion
AI offers significant promise for improving diagnostics, risk prediction, and individualized therapy in thrombosis and haemostasis. Future integration depends on transparent, validated, and equitable AI systems embedded within clinical workflows.},

The firm promotes a romantic-managerial conception of AI that suggests business specialists can help organizations reap the benefits of the miraculous promises of a human-centered AI, without incurring any of the drawbacks, based on the assumption that it is possible to control AI. Three complementary discursive archetypes are mobilized by the firm to spur organizations into action: the prophet, arousing enthusiasm by spreading the “Good News” about AI; the demystifier, numbing concerns about the potential drifts of the technical society; and the bird of ill omen, stoking a fear of inertia. This study highlights the relevance of Jacques Ellul’s work to stimulate the ongoing debate within the critical accounting community about the perils of AI’s proliferation in organizations and society. Beyond its traditional function of legitimizing expertise, content marketing is mobilized as a propaganda vehicle for a conception of AI seemingly shaped in the mold of the firm’s own professional services offering. Finally, by showing how the precepts of propaganda are incorporated into content marketing, this study highlights the commercialization of contemporary social issues as a pivotal step in the colonization of professional accounting services by marketing expertise.},

    abstract = {Background
This study aims to determine the efficacy of the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in rewriting orthopaedic trauma hospital patient educational materials to a patient-appropriate reading level.
Materials and methods
35 orthopaedic patient educational articles were identified from three hospital networks with Level 1 Trauma Centers, categorized based on average reading level. They were run through a formatting Python code, and then a secondary code to determine readability metrics outlined in Table 1. The articles were then rewritten via four iterations of Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT) AI language models. Each model was given the same prompt, outlined in Fig. 1, to rewrite the articles to a 6th grade reading level per AMA recommendations. The rewritten articles were checked for accuracy and formatted and scored to determine mean reading level. Additional analysis was run comparing 9 different AI models from 3 different companies, using the same prompt, comparing cost and percent token reduction.
Results
All GPT AI models lowered the mean combined grade level (Table 2). Fig. 2 compares each GPT model's output to the original articles reading grade level. The oldest model (GPT-3.5-Turbo) was the least consistent and least effective. GPT-4o-Mini and GPT-4o were the most effective and consistent regardless of original article difficulty. Table 3 outlines the cost of running all 35 articles through each GPT model. The most accurate model (GPT-4o) was only $0.61; however, there was only a 0.421 % increase in effectiveness comparing GPT-4o vs. GPT-4o-Mini, at a 175.38 % increase in cost. All GPT rewritten articles were screened for accuracy and determined to have no falsified information or medical inaccuracies. Expanded analysis across 9 AI models is demonstrated in Fig. 4. Fig. 5 compares cost and percent token reduction.
Conclusion
AI is a viable option for reducing the reading difficulty of patient educational materials while maintaining accuracy. Of the models included for analysis, GPT-4o-Mini appears to be the most efficient language model when considering effectiveness, cost, and maintenance of the information included in the original articles.},

    abstract = {Background
There is growing interest in applying generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) to respond to electronic patient portal messages, particularly in primary care where message volumes are highest. However, evaluations of GenAI as an inbox communication tool are limited. Qualitative analysis of when and how often GenAI responses achieve communication goals can inform estimates of impact and guide continuous improvement.
Objective
This study aims to evaluate GenAI responses to primary care messages using a medical communication framework.
Methods
This was a descriptive quality improvement study of 201 GenAI replies to a purposively sampled, diverse pool of real primary care patient messages in a large midwestern academic medical center. Two physician reviewers (NSL and NR) used a hybrid deductive-inductive approach to qualitatively identify and define themes, guided by constructs from the “best practice” medical communication framework. After achieving thematic saturation, the reviewers assessed the presence or absence of identified communication themes, both independently and collaboratively. Discrepant observations were reconciled via discussion. Frequencies of identified themes were tallied.
Results
Themes in strengths and limitations emerged across 5 communication domains. In the domain of rapport building, expressing respect and restating key phrases were strengths, while inappropriate or inadequate rapport building statements were limitations. For information gathering, questions that built toward a plan or elicited patient needs were strengths, while questions that were out of place or redundant were limitations. For information delivery, accurate content delivered clearly and professionally was a strength, but delivery of inaccurate content was an observed limitation. GenAI responses could facilitate next steps by outlining choices or providing instruction, but sometimes those next steps were inappropriate or premature. Finally, in responding to emotion, strengths were that emotions were named and validated, while inadequate or absent acknowledgment of emotion was a limitation. Overall, 26.4% (53/201) of all messages displayed communication strengths without limitations, 27.4% (55/201) had limitations without strengths, and the remaining 46.3% (93/201) had both. Strengths outnumbered limitations in rapport building (87/201, 43.3% vs 35/201, 17.4%) and facilitating next steps (73/201, 36.3% vs 39/201, 19.4%). Limitations outnumbered strengths in the remaining domains of information delivery (89/201, 44.3% vs 43/201, 21.4%), information gathering (60/201, 29.9% vs 43/201, 21.4%), and responding to emotion (7/201, 8.5% vs 9/201, 4.5%).
Conclusions
GenAI response quality on behalf of primary care physicians and advanced practice providers may vary by communication function. Expressions of respect or descriptions of common next steps may be appropriate, but gathering and delivering appropriate information, or responding to emotion, may be limited. While communication standards were often met, they were also often compromised. Understanding these strengths and limitations can inform decisions about whether, when, and how to apply GenAI as a tool for primary care inbox communication.},

Left bundle branch block (LBBB) is a common electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormality associated with left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD). Although artificial intelligence (AI)–driven ECG analysis shows promise for LVSD screening, it remains unclear if a general AI-ECG model or one tailored for LBBB patients yields better performance.
Objectives
This study evaluates 4 AI-ECG models for detecting LVSD in LBBB patients and examines the impact of training cohort definitions.
Methods
We developed 4 models using 364,845 ECGs from 4 hospitals: 1) a general AI-ECG model; 2) a model trained on automatically extracted LBBB cases; 3) a model trained on a well-curated single-center LBBB data set with expert review; and 4) a hybrid model employing transfer learning by fine-tuning the general model with single-center LBBB data. LVSD was defined as an ejection fraction ≤40%. All models were externally validated on 1,334 ECGs from another hospital, with performance assessed by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values.
Results
In external validation, the transfer learning model achieved the highest AUROC (0.903; 95% CI: 0.887-0.918), closely followed by the general model (0.899; 95% CI: 0.883-0.915); the difference was not significant. Models using automated or expert-based LBBB extraction had lower AUROCs (0.879 and 0.841, respectively). The general model demonstrated high sensitivity, whereas the transfer learning model exhibited superior specificity.
Conclusions
Our findings indicate that a broad AI-ECG model reliably detects LVSD in LBBB patients, and transfer learning offers modest improvements without requiring curated LBBB data sets. Evaluating algorithms in representative clinical populations is essential.},

    abstract = {Introduction
Over 90% of pregnant women and 76% expectant fathers search for pregnancy health information. We examined readability, accuracy and quality of answers to common obstetric anesthesia questions from the popular generative artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots ChatGPT and Bard.
Methods
Twenty questions for generative AI chatbots were derived from frequently asked questions based on professional society, hospital and consumer websites. ChatGPT and Bard were queried in November 2023. Answers were graded for accuracy by four obstetric anesthesiologists. Quality was measured using Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool for Print (PEMAT). Readability was measured using six readability indices. Accuracy, quality and readability were compared using independent t-test.
Results
Bard readability scores were high school level, significantly easier than ChatGPT’s college level by all scoring metrics (P <0.001). Bard had significantly longer answers (P <0.001), yet with similar accuracy of Bard (85% ± 10) and ChatGPT (87% ± 14) (P=0.5). PEMAT understandability scores were no statistically significantly different (P=0.06). Actionability by PEMAT scores for Bard was significantly higher (22% vs. 9%) than ChatGPT (P=0.007)
Conclusion
Answers to questions about “labor epidurals” should be accurate, high quality, and easy to read. Bard at high school reading level, was well above the goal 4th to 6th grade level suggested for patient materials. Consumers, health care providers, hospitals and governmental agencies should be aware of the quality of information generated by chatbots. Chatbots should meet the standards for readability and understandability of health-related questions, to aid public understanding and enhance shared decision-making.},

Unlike traditional ML models that predict based on existing data, this framework innovatively generates new concrete mix designs that meet specific requirements such as strength, cost-efficiency, and reduced embodied CO2. To propose a powerful and reliable generative AI model, several advanced ML algorithms were considered, e.g., CatBoost, XGBoost, and LGBM. These models were trained on a unique dataset consisting of 4,936 data points collected from five different batching plants and have not been published yet. Bayesian Optimisation was employed to fine-tune model hyperparameters, resulting in the most effective models attaining R2 values of 0.94 and 0.89 for raw and grouped data, respectively. To verify the trained generative AI model, a case study was conducted, in which the model was requested to provide designs of a mix with pre-determined strength and optimised cost and embodied CO2. The mix designs generated by the framework were successfully validated through experimental tests, corroborating the predictive outcomes. The research culminated in the development of a web application, a tool crafted to streamline the concrete mixture design and optimisation process.

    abstract = {Background
Clinical decision-making is a core competency in emergency nursing, requiring rapid and accurate assessments. With the growing integration of Generative Artificial Intelligence in healthcare, there is a pressing need to understand its potential as a clinical decision support tool. While Generative Artificial Intelligence models show high accuracy and consistency, their ability to navigate complex, context-sensitive scenarios remains in question.
Objectives
This study aimed to compare the clinical decision-making performance of emergency nurses from Israel and Italy with Generative Artificial Intelligence models (Claude-3.5, ChatGPT-4.0, and Gemini-1.5). It evaluated differences in severity assessment, hospitalization decisions, and test selection, while exploring the influence of demographic and professional characteristics on decision accuracy.
Methods
A prospective observational study was conducted among 82 emergency nurses (49 from Italy, 33 from Israel), each independently evaluating five standardized clinical cases. Their decisions were compared with those generated by Generative Artificial Intelligence models using a structured evaluation rubric. Statistical analyses included ANOVA, chi-square tests, logistic regression, and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis to assess predictive accuracy.
Results
Generative Artificial Intelligence models exhibited higher overall decision accuracy and stronger alignment with expert recommendations. However, notable discrepancies emerged in hospitalization decisions and severity assessments. For example, in Case 2, Generative Artificial Intelligence rated severity as level 1, while Italian and Israeli nurses rated it at 1.98 and 2.23, respectively (P < 0.01, F = 199). In Case 1, only 4.1 % of Italian nurses recommended hospitalization compared to 30.3 % of Israeli nurses, whereas all Generative Artificial Intelligence models advised hospitalization. Nurses showed greater variability in test selection and severity judgments, reflecting their use of clinical intuition and contextual reasoning. Demographics such as age, gender, and years of experience did not significantly predict accuracy.
Conclusions
Generative Artificial Intelligence models demonstrated consistency and expert alignment but lacked the contextual sensitivity vital in emergency care. These results highlight the potential of Generative Artificial Intelligence as a clinical decision-support tool while emphasizing the continued importance of human clinical judgment.},

These findings were compared with responses from a sample of Australian and Chinese trainee teachers, comprising individuals nearing qualification with varied demographic and educational backgrounds. Eight vignettes depicting students with varying abilities and efforts were evaluated by the LLMs ten times each, resulting in 320 evaluations, with trainee teachers providing comparable ratings. For LD students, the LLMs exhibited lower frustration and higher sympathy than trainee teachers, while for non-LD students, LLMs similarly showed lower frustration, with ChatGPT3.5 aligning closely with Chinese teachers and ChatGPT4 demonstrating more sympathy than both teacher groups. Notably, LLMs expressed lower expectations of future academic failure for both LD and non-LD students compared to trainee teachers. Regarding feedback, the findings reflect ratings of the qualitative nature of feedback LLMs and teachers would provide, rather than actual feedback text. The LLMs, particularly ChatGPT3.5 and Gemini, were rated as providing more negative feedback than trainee teachers, while ChatGPT4 provided more positive ratings for both LD and non-LD students, aligning with Chinese teachers in some cases. These findings suggest that LLMs may promote a positive and inclusive outlook for LD students by exhibiting lower judgmental tendencies and higher optimism. However, their tendency to rate feedback more negatively than trainee teachers highlights the need to recalibrate AI tools to better align with cultural and emotional nuances.},

To quantify AI trends in vision science, we evaluated over 100,000 PubMed article metadata spanning 35 years. Using Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms, we analyzed trends across four prominent ocular diseases: age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and cataract. Most articles utilized research techniques from at least one of the following domains: biological models, molecular profiling, image-based analysis, and clinical outcomes. Our quantification reveals that AI prominence is disproportionally concentrated in the image-based analysis domain, and, additionally, among 4 diseases evaluated, AI prevalence in cataract research is lagging. Contributing factors towards these disparities include insufficient data standardization, complex data structures, limited data availability, unresolved ethical concerns, and not gaining meaningful improvements over human-based interpretations. By mapping where AI thrives and where it lags, we offer a quantitative reference for funding agencies, clinicians, and vision scientists.

    abstract = {Introduction
Artificial intelligence has permeated all aspects of our existence, and medical imaging has shown the burgeoning use of artificial intelligence in clinical environments. However, there are limited empirical studies on radiography students' use of artificial intelligence for learning and assessment. Therefore, this study aimed to gain an understanding of this phenomenon.
Methods
The study used a qualitative explorative and descriptive research design. Data was obtained through five focus group interviews with purposively sampled undergraduate medical imaging and radiation science students at a single higher education institution in South Africa. Verbatim transcripts of the audio-recorded interviews were analysed thematically.
Results
Three themes and related subthemes were developed: 1) understanding artificial intelligence, 2) experiences with the use of artificial intelligence with the subthemes of the use of artificial intelligence in theoretical and clinical learning and challenges of using artificial intelligence, and 3) incorporation of artificial intelligence in undergraduate medical imaging and radiation sciences education with the subthemes of student education, ethical considerations and responsible use and curriculum integration of artificial intelligence in relation to learning and assessment.
Conclusion
Participants used artificial intelligence for learning and assessment by generating ideas to enhance academic writing, as a learning tool, finding literature, language translation and for enhanced efficiency. Simulation-based artificial intelligence supports students' clinical learning, and artificial intelligence within the clinical departments assists with improved patient outcomes. However, participants expressed concerns about the reliability and ethical implications of artificial intelligence-generated information. To address these concerns, participants suggested integrating artificial intelligence into medical imaging and radiation sciences education, where educators need to educate students on the responsible use of artificial intelligence in learning and consider artificial intelligence in assessments.
Implications for practice
The study findings contribute to understanding medical imaging and radiation sciences students’ use of artificial intelligence and may be used to develop evidence-based strategies for integrating artificial intelligence into the curriculum to enhance medical imaging and radiation sciences education and support students.},

Exploring the integration of artificial intelligence in clinical settings, this study examined the feasibility of using Generative Pretrained Transformer 4 (GPT-4), a large language model, as a consultation assistant in a hand surgery outpatient clinic.
Methods
The study involved 10 simulated patient scenarios with common hand conditions, where GPT-4, enhanced through specific prompt engineering techniques, conducted medical history interviews, and assisted in diagnostic processes. A panel of expert hand surgeons, each board-certified in hand surgery, evaluated GPT-4’s responses using a Likert Scale across five criteria with scores ranging from 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest).
Results
Generative Pretrained Transformer 4 achieved an average score of 4.6, reflecting good performance in documenting a medical history, as evaluated by the hand surgeons.
Conclusions
These findings suggest that GPT-4 can effectively document medical histories to meet the standards of hand surgeons in a simulated environment. The findings indicate potential for future application in patient care, but the actual performance of GPT-4 in real clinical settings remains to be investigated.

Artificial intelligence (AI) continues to advance in healthcare, offering innovative approaches to enhance clinical decision-making and patient management. Peripheral nerve surgery poses unique challenges due to the complexity of cases and the need for precise diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. This study investigates the application of OpenAI's generative AI model, o1, in assisting with intricate decision-making processes in peripheral nerve surgery.
Methods
Using advanced prompt engineering techniques, o1 was configured as a virtual medical assistant (Generative Pretrained Transformer–Nerve Surgery [GPT-NS]) to process 5 simulated clinical scenarios modeled after real-world cases. The AI guided surgeons through medical history, diagnostics, and treatment planning, culminating in case summaries. A panel of nerve surgery specialists and residents evaluated the AI's performance using a Likert scale across 7 criteria.
Results
GPT-NS demonstrated strong capabilities, achieving an average score of 4.3. High ratings were observed for understanding clinical issues and case presentation clarity. However, areas for improvement were noted in diagnostic sequencing and treatment recommendations. Despite a lower score indicating human evaluators’ perception of their superiority over the AI in handling cases, GPT-NS showed promise as a supportive tool in clinical practice.
Conclusions
As the performance of large language model AI continues to improve, it is becoming increasingly important that absolute experts assess the accuracy of the answers to ensure reliable and clinically sound integration into healthcare practices. This study underscores the potential of large language model AI in augmenting clinical decision-making in highly specialized fields like peripheral nerve surgery while demonstrating the ongoing importance of human expertise.

The results show that under a single load value target condition of the designed structure, the minimum deviation index (R2) between the load value corresponding to the displacement point and the target load value is only 0.987, and the maximum mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is only 5.92 %. When considering the elastic modulus target, the approach successfully conducts two sets of combined structural designs meeting the requirements of both high and low elastic moduli. When targeting the specified load-displacement curve conditions, specifically when combining high elastic modulus with ascending plasticity, the designed structures exhibit an error of only 2.2 % compared to the target property. Moreover, the quasi-static uniaxial compression experiments conducted on additively manufactured designed structures confirm that the experimental curves match the target curves in terms of deformation trends and load value ranges. The success of this inverse design approach for cellular TPMS structures has the potential to expedite new structural material development processes.},

This study employs the Critical Interpretive Synthesis (CIS) approach to explore the impacts and challenges of AI on graphic design. Through a comprehensive review of 33 papers, this research reveals four research paradigms of AI in graphic design: Artificial Intelligence Driven Design Automation and Generation (AIDAG), Artificial Intelligence Assisted Graphic Design and Image Processing (AGDIP), Artificial Intelligence in Art and Creative Design Processes (AACDP), and Artificial Intelligence Enhanced Visual Attention and Emotional Response Modeling (AVERM). These paradigms demonstrate the multidimensional role of AI in design, ranging from automation to emotional interaction. The findings suggest that AI serves a dual role as both a design tool and a medium for innovation. AI not only enhances the automation and efficiency of the design process but also fosters designers' creative thinking and understanding of users' emotional needs. This study also proposes a path for the application of the four paradigms in the graphic design process, providing effective design ideas for future design workflows.},

    abstract = {Background
Generative artificial intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly deployed in clinical pharmacy; yet, systematic evaluation of their efficacy, limitations, and risks across diverse practice scenarios remains limited.
Objective
This study aims to quantitatively evaluate and compare the performance of 8 mainstream generative AI systems across 4 core clinical pharmacy scenarios—medication consultation, medication education, prescription review, and case analysis with pharmaceutical care—using a multidimensional framework.
Methods
Forty-eight clinically validated questions were selected via stratified sampling from real-world sources (eg, hospital consultations, clinical case banks, and national pharmacist training databases). Three researchers simultaneously tested 8 different generative AI systems (ERNIE Bot, Doubao, Kimi, Qwen, GPT-4o, Gemini-1.5-Pro, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, and DeepSeek-R1) using standardized prompts within a single day (February 20, 2025). A double-blind scoring design was used, with 6 experienced clinical pharmacists (≥5 years experience) evaluating the AI responses across 6 dimensions: accuracy, rigor, applicability, logical coherence, conciseness, and universality, scored 0‐10 per predefined criteria (eg, −3 for inaccuracy and −2 for incomplete rigor). Statistical analysis used one-way ANOVA with Tukey Honestly Significant Difference (HSD) post hoc testing and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) for interrater reliability (2-way random model). Qualitative thematic analysis identified recurrent errors and limitations.
Results
DeepSeek-R1 (DeepSeek) achieved the highest overall performance (mean composite score: medication consultation 9.4, SD 1.0; case analysis 9.3, SD 1.0), significantly outperforming others in complex tasks (P<.05). Critical limitations were observed across models, including high-risk decision errors—75% omitted critical contraindications (eg, ethambutol in optic neuritis) and a lack of localization—90% erroneously recommended macrolides for drug-resistant Mycoplasma pneumoniae (China’s high-resistance setting), while only DeepSeek-R1 aligned with updated American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines for pediatric doxycycline. Complex reasoning deficits: only Claude-3.5-Sonnet detected a gender-diagnosis contradiction (prostatic hyperplasia in female); no model identified diazepam’s 7-day prescription limit. Interrater consistency was lowest for conciseness in case analysis (ICC=0.70), reflecting evaluator disagreement on complex outputs. ERNIE Bot (Baidu) consistently underperformed (case analysis: 6.8, SD 1.5; P<.001 vs DeepSeek-R1).
Conclusions
While generative AI shows promise as a pharmacist assistance tool, significant limitations—including high-risk errors (eg, contraindication omissions), inadequate localization, and complex reasoning gaps—preclude autonomous clinical decision-making. Performance stratification highlights DeepSeek-R1’s current advantage, but all systems require optimization in dynamic knowledge updating, complex scenario reasoning, and output interpretability. Future deployment must prioritize human oversight (human-AI co-review), ethical safeguards, and continuous evaluation frameworks.},

The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) offers unprecedented opportunities to transform this paradigm.

This paper proposes a novel L0-L5 evolutionary framework to systematically guide the integration of LLMs into evidence-based clinical decision-making. The framework delineates a progressive path from current EBM practices (L0) through AI-assisted evidence retrieval (L1), accelerated evidence synthesis (L2), real-world data analysis (L3), digital twin-based personalized evidence (L4), to generative model-driven virtual evidence creation (L5). Each level represents increasing capabilities in addressing the core tensions between evidence timeliness, personalization resolution, and decision transparency. This framework offers a structured approach to harness the transformative potential of LLMs while preserving the fundamental principles of EBM, ultimately enabling truly personalized precision medicine grounded in robust evidence.},

By leveraging large language models and prompt engineering patterns, we examined how GenAI could generate accurate, relevant, and inspiring content through various interaction scenarios. Our findings suggest that GenAI significantly mitigates early-stage entrepreneurial information asymmetry and supports sophisticated problem-solving when coupled with appropriate domain knowledge and prompt engineering techniques. However, GenAI’s task complexity limits its use in late-stage entrepreneurial exploitation activities. Finally, this study provides insight into research avenues and practical applications.},

Heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems are critical in this context, given their role in stabilizing these environmental factors. Gaps in Design and Construction (D&C) can critically undermine the reliability, performance, quality, and lifespan of HVAC systems during their Operation and Maintenance (O&M) stages. Current studies illustrate how existing models predicted performance degradation and how the Design, Construction, Operations, and Maintenance (DCOM) gap arises. Despite the substantial implications for Semiconductor Manufacturing Facilities (SMFs), research on HVAC performance degradation remains limited, particularly in capturing and quantifying degradation-related patterns. Compared to other types of buildings, the renovation and transformation of high-end manufacturing facilities are more frequent, and customized design and equipment also lead to model application issues, such as data limitations and incompatibility. This paper aims to propose a novel HVAC system degradation prediction model utilizing Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and Informer algorithms based on the building characteristics and operation mode of semiconductor facilities to overcome the limitations of data scarcity and long-term prediction, evaluate the comprehensive impact of the gap between D&C and O&M stages on HVAC systems. By integrating data augmentation, this model reduces data dependency and can handle incomplete, inconsistent, or discrete data for early prediction in operation, bridging the gap between D&C and O&M stages, and improving the overall efficiency and effectiveness of facility operation and maintenance. In addition to SMFs, the proposed model exhibits considerable application potential in other high-precision building types due to the structural variability.},

The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) presents new opportunities to improve clinical decision-making and operational effectiveness in this field. This structured narrative review identified and evaluated studies applying AI and ML in transfusion medicine. A search of PubMed and Scopus for articles published between January 2018 and April 2025 yielded 565 publications. Studies were included if they applied AI or ML techniques, focused on transfusion management or decision support, and were evaluated using electronic health records or expert review. Four exemplar studies were selected, each representing a distinct AI paradigm: supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement, and generative learning. These studies were critically appraised for methodological rigor, clinical relevance, and potential for implementation in practice. The reviewed studies reflected a clear shift from traditional analytic methods toward more advanced computational approaches to improve prediction accuracy, optimize resource allocation, and support clinical decision-making. Three overarching themes emerged: the need to balance model complexity with interpretability and clinical feasibility; the impact of data quality and preprocessing on model performance and fairness; and the barriers to broader applicability and cross-institutional deployment. As technological barriers continue to decline, future challenges will increasingly center on privacy regulations, infrastructure constraints, and aligning model complexity with practical utility. Thoughtful integration of these considerations through scalable, clinical-grade, and transparent solutions will be critical in realizing the full potential of AI and ML in transfusion medicine.},

However, limited research has been conducted on factors influencing customers’ intention to switch from traditional to artificial intelligence (AI) based banking services. Therefore, the present study explored the key antecedents of the aforementioned intention.
Methods
This two-stage study was based on the push–pull–mooring model. In Stage 1, in-depth semistructured interviews were conducted with stakeholders related to AI-based banking services to identify critical factors influencing customers’ intention to switch from traditional to AI-based customer services. In Stage 2, the results obtained in Stage 1 were combined with results from the literature to create a second-order model and direct-effect model (Models 1 and 2, respectively). Quantitative survey data were then collected to validate these models.
Results
Model 1 indicated that among pull, push, and mooring factors, pull factors had the strongest effect on the aforementioned intention, followed by mooring factors and then push factors. The explanatory power (R2) of this model was 70 %. Furthermore, Model 2 indicated that the attractiveness of the alternative (a pull factor) and the need for interpersonal interaction and inertia (mooring factors) were the key factors influencing switching intention. The explanatory power (R2) of this model was 76 %.
Conclusion
In summary, this study identified and validated critical factors affecting customers’ intention to switch to AI-based banking services. The findings enrich the understanding the social interaction and user behavior of AI, offering valuable insights for promoting AI-driven services and applications.},

The use of AI in diagnostics, image processing and interpretation, treatment personalization, clinical documentation, and drug discovery is an example of the implementation of AI in Western medicine. The need for evidence-based studies and a standardized approach to scientific medicine aligns well with these applications. AI can leave a lasting impact on the Chinese medicine (CM) landscape by increasing expectations and presenting new challenges. The analogy between the CM-specific diagnostic methods and syndrome differentiation, which is holistic, pattern-oriented, patient-centered, and clinical data analysis, is significant at multiple levels. These qualities pose challenges for AI usage in CM, which heavily relies on structured data and pattern recognition. Despite these adversities, AI can still be used in CM through data standardization, prediction formulation, and treatment planning, provided that the integration of this tool considers the primary principles of CM and adheres to ethical and regulatory considerations. This review examines the dichotomous approach to health and medicine in the contexts of AI and CM, highlighting the evolving potential, inherent limitations, and ethical and regulatory issues associated with the application of AI to CM.

However, many teacher training programs struggle to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge to real-world applications. The current study tackles this challenge by developing a generative artificial intelligence (GenAI)-enhanced simulation to improve preservice teachers’ problem-solving abilities. Using design-based research (DBR), we created a virtual environment that integrates problem-based learning (PBL) with GenAI technology. The simulation was rigorously refined through expert review and usability testing before being implemented in a teacher training program. We evaluated its effectiveness by comparing three groups: (1) a text-based scenario, (2) a rule-based simulation, and (3) a GenAI-enhanced simulation. Pre- and post-test results showed significant improvements in problem-solving skills for both the rule-based and GenAI-enhanced simulation groups compared to the text-based scenario group. Notably, qualitative findings revealed that students reported heightened realism and immersion in the GenAI-enhanced simulation, attributing this to more dynamic interactions with AI agents that helped them better contextualize PBL and increased their motivation. Our study findings contribute design principles for developing GenAI-enhanced simulations in teacher education, offering promising insights into leveraging AI technology to create more engaging and effective training experiences.},

    abstract = {Structured Abstract
Purpose
This study aims to systematically synthesize the practical applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in patent analysis by constructing a comprehensive matrix that aligns distinct AI techniques with their corresponding analytical tasks. The “AI Technique and Analytical Task” matrix provides a structured framework for understanding how various AI approaches are deployed across different functional objectives within the patent analysis domain.
Design/methodology/approach
This study integrates bibliometric analysis, BERT-based topic modeling, and literature review to explore AI applications in patent analysis. Data were retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection using a dual-focus search strategy targeting AI techniques and patent analysis tasks. A clear distinction was made to exclude studies analyzing AI trends using patent data, retaining only those applying AI methods to patent analytics. With these strategies, 718 relevant publications were selected as the basis for analysis.
Findings
The results reveal exponential growth in AI-powered patent analysis research since the mid-2010s, with Technological Forecasting and Social Change (TFSC), Scientometrics, and World Patent Information (WPI) identified as the leading publication platforms. Geographical analysis shows that China and South Korea have rapidly increased their research output and institutional engagement, while the U.S. maintains a foundational yet less recent presence. With topic modeling technique, this study identified eleven major thematic clusters, spanning tasks such as emerging knowledge discovery, technology forecasting, and opportunity identification. These were integrated into “AI Technique and Analytical Task” matrix, which systematically maps the relationships between AI methods (such as pretrained language models, convolutional neural networks, semantic analysis, and topic modeling) and their practical implementations. Among these, patent classification and nature language processing (NLP) emerged as the most impactful applications, underscoring AI's vital role in enabling scalable, data-driven approaches to managing complex patent information.
Originality
This study presents a novel integration of multi-layered literature retrieval strategies, bibliometric analysis, BERT-based topic modeling, and an AI technique-to-analytical task matrix to construct a systematic and structured knowledge framework. This integrative approach not only delineates the interdisciplinary evolution of AI applications in patent analysis but also provides strategic guidance for future research, particularly in advancing empirical validation, informing policy applications, and promoting global inclusivity in this emerging field.},

However, the practical application of perovskite-based optoelectronic synaptic transistors has been hindered by issues of poor stability and high toxicity. This study developed an artificial synaptic thin film transistor (TFT) based on a Cs2AgBiBr6/InOx bilayer. The device demonstrated synaptic behavior under optoelectronic hybrid stimulation (largest wavelength ∼520 nm), such as excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC), inhibitory postsynaptic current (IPSC), paired-pulse facilitation (PPF), spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), short-term memory (STM) and long-term memory (LTM). Notably, the “light writing and voltage erasing” characteristics of these devices could be utilized to construct a convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier for the CIFAR-10 dataset, demonstrating noise tolerance close to the human eye. The loss in recognition accuracy was within 1 % when Gaussian white noise and salt pepper noise were added. Furthermore, these devices exhibited great potential in cycle-consistent generative adversarial networks (CycleGAN), with the generated image quality achieving levels of 0.637 and 0.715 in improved perceptual image processing system (IPIPS) and structural similarity index measure (SSIM) evaluation metrics for the zebra dataset, indicating good image quality.

The data-based randomized approach applies controlled randomness for augmentation. The mechanism-based domain-specific techniques advocate for exploring relationships between the physical entity and monitoring data for generating by reasoned inference.

    abstract = {Summary
The mRNA-based therapeutics, notably mRNA vaccines, represent a new era of powerful tools to combat various diseases. However, the relatively low translation efficiency of exogenous mRNA often limits its wide application. Here, we propose a computational framework called UTailoR (UTR tailor), which significantly improves the challenge by optimizing 5' UTR sequences based on a two-step artificial intelligence strategy. We first develop a deep-learning-based discriminative model for predicting mRNA translation efficiency with 5' UTR sequences, and then present a generative model to generate optimized 5' UTR sequences, which are designed to be highly close to the original sequences but predicted to result in high translation efficiency. The experimental results show that the UTailoR-optimized sequences outstrip the corresponding original sequences by ∼ 200%. This work provides an efficient and convenient method for the mRNA 5' UTR optimization, which can be easily accessed at http://www.cuilab.cn/utailor.},

    abstract = {While generative artificial intelligence (GAI) is increasingly used to create content, it is often criticized for collecting and training private data and induces potential copy infringement issue. This dilemma leaves a question of whether GAI increases or decreases creators' work sharing. Drawn on protection motivation theory, this study examines how the launch of a GAI system affects creators' contributions on an original work sharing platform. We discover that GAI poses a threat to drawing-category creators, leading to a significant crowding-out effect on their contributions. Specifically, compared with that of non-drawing-category creators, the work sharing of drawing-category creators decreases by 19.64 % and 14.29 % within a short period after the launch and removal of the GAI system, respectively. We discover that creators' protective behavior is driven by GAI-related copyright infringement. Compared with creators without copyright protection, those with copyright protection are more inclined to cease contributions or even leave the platform. We further find that among copyright-protected creators, top creators, evidenced by their acquisition of a large number of supporters or platform honor titles, exhibit more pronounced responses to protect their works due to their higher coping efficacy. Notably, this threat reduces creators' sharing behavior or even lead to their exit from the platform. Nevertheless, such reduction is likely to gradually recover once the threat subsides. Overall, our findings have important implications for whether and how platform managers adopt GAI systems, especially in an original work sharing context.},

Thus, a framework that combines the generative factory design approach with key environmental assessment parameters is introduced. The effectiveness of generative design in enhancing the environmental performance of factory buildings is demonstrated with a case study. A comparative analysis of different designs highlights main influencing factors, as well as trade-offs and synergies between different manufacturing system performances and environmental oriented objectives. With that, the paper underlines the value of generative design as a transformative tool in sustainable factory design and provides actionable insights for architects, engineers, and policymakers aiming to develop greener industrial facilities.},

How to effectively integrate these multi-dimensional features and establish stable associations between different modalities remains a technical challenge. To this end, this article explores the application of artificial intelligence algorithms, especially spatial attention and channel attention mechanisms, in dynamic image and video generation to achieve more accurate semantic consistency between text and images. This article introduces a spatial attention mechanism, which dynamically focuses on the spatial area related to the text description by calculating the similarity between text and image features; at the same time, the channel attention mechanism further optimizes the match with the text description by adjusting the channel weights in the image feature map. In addition, the study introduces user interaction design, and users can influence the generation target of the generator through real-time feedback and adjustment, making it more personalized and in line with needs. The optimization process of the generator and the discriminator further improves the realism and quality of dynamic image and video generation through GAN (Generative Adversarial Network). Experiments show that the proposed method can effectively enhance the semantic consistency in the image generation process and provide new technical support for dynamic visual communication design.},

    abstract = {Purpose
Snapchat is a prominent social media site among youth. In April 2023, Snapchat released an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered chatbot that was automatically implemented on all accounts. Given the apparent ease in communicating with this feature, youth may use it as an information source.
Methods
While Snapchat purports to block results for drug keywords, it is unclear the extent to which this type of content is blocked. In August 2024–January 2025, we asked Snapchat AI questions related to delta-8, a derived intoxicating cannabis product that has been rapidly rising in popularity in the United States and has limited regulations. Qualitative responses were independently coded into thematic categories.
Results
The AI prompted individuals to ask follow-up questions, which largely drove the themes. Themes included general information (similarity to delta-9 THC, but with a purported lower potency; relaxing/euphoric effects; legality), use motives (pain relief, anti-nausea, appetite stimulation, anxiety reduction), potential consequences (dry mouth, red eyes, increased heart rate, drowsiness, contaminated products, inaccurate labeling), retail availability, and product recommendations. Responses did not provide supporting citations. While the AI did not block results related to delta-8, it did block results pertaining to “weed” and “THC.”
Discussion
Snapchat AI is a plausible information source about delta-8 THC among youth. No citations were provided to support claims made by the AI, which portrayed delta-8 THC use favorably, as having benefits and low risks from use. Findings have policy implications, including restricting or regulating this type of content—particularly relating to claims without supporting scientific evidence.},

    abstract = {Background
The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized medical research, offering innovative solutions for data collection, patient engagement, and information dissemination. Powerful generative AI (GenAI) tools and other similar chatbots have emerged, facilitating user interactions with virtual conversational agents. However, the increasing use of GenAI tools in medical research presents challenges, including ethical concerns, data privacy issues, and the potential for generating false content. These issues necessitate standardization of reporting to ensure transparency and scientific rigor.
Objective
The development of the Generative Artificial Intelligence Tools in Medical Research (GAMER) reporting guidelines aims to establish comprehensive, standardized guidelines for reporting the use of GenAI tools in medical research.
Methods
The GAMER guidelines are being developed following the methodology recommended by the Enhancing the Quality and Transparency of Health Research (EQUATOR) Network, involving a scoping review and expert Delphi consensus. The scoping review searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar (for the first 200 results) using keywords like “generative AI” and “medical research” to identify reporting elements in GenAI-related studies. The Delphi process involves 30-50 experts with ≥3 years of experience in AI applications or medical research, selected based on publication records and expertise across disciplines (eg, clinicians and data scientists) and regions (eg, Asia and Europe). A 7-point-scale survey will establish consensus on checklist items. The testing phase invites authors to apply the GAMER checklist to GenAI-related manuscripts and provide feedback via a questionnaire, while experts assess reliability (κ statistic) and usability (time taken, 7-point Likert scale). The study has been approved by the Ethics Committee of the Institute of Health Data Science at Lanzhou University (HDS-202406-01).
Results
The GAMER project was launched in July 2023 by the Evidence-Based Medicine Center of Lanzhou University and the WHO Collaborating Centre for Guideline Implementation and Knowledge Translation, and it concluded in July 2024. The scoping review was completed in November 2023. The Delphi process was conducted from October 2023 to April 2024. The testing phase began in March 2025 and is ongoing. The expected outcome of the GAMER project is a reporting checklist accompanied by relevant terminology, examples, and explanations to guide stakeholders in better reporting the use of GenAI tools.
Conclusions
GAMER aims to guide researchers, reviewers, and editors in the transparent and scientific application of GenAI tools in medical research. By providing a standardized reporting checklist, GAMER seeks to enhance the clarity, completeness, and integrity of research involving GenAI tools, thereby promoting collaboration, comparability, and cumulative knowledge generation in AI-driven health care technologies.

    abstract = {Objectives
This study aimed to systematically map the development methods, scope, and limitations of existing artificial intelligence (AI) reporting guidelines in medicine and to explore their applicability to generative AI (GAI) tools, such as large language models (LLMs).
Study Design and Setting
We reported a scoping review adhering to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews. Five information sources were searched, including MEDLINE (via PubMed), Enhancing the QUAlity and Transparency Of health Research (EQUATOR) Network, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, FAIRsharing, and Google Scholar, from inception to December 31, 2024. Two reviewers independently screened records and extracted data using a predefined Excel template. Data included guideline characteristics (eg, development methods, target audience, AI domain), adherence to EQUATOR Network recommendations, and consensus methodologies. Discrepancies were resolved by a third reviewer.
Results
Sixty-eight AI reporting guidelines were included; 48.5% focused on general AI, whereas only 7.4% addressed GAI/LLMs. Methodological rigor was limited; 39.7% described development processes, 42.6% involved multidisciplinary experts, and 33.8% followed EQUATOR recommendations. Significant overlap existed, particularly in medical imaging (20.6% of guidelines). GAI-specific guidelines (14.7%) lacked comprehensive coverage and methodological transparency.
Conclusion
Existing AI reporting guidelines in medicine have suboptimal methodological rigor, redundancy, and insufficient coverage of GAI applications. Future and updated guidelines should prioritize standardized development processes, multidisciplinary collaboration, and expanded focus on emerging AI technologies like LLMs.},

Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are chronic conditions that can lead to a physical, social, and economic burden. Generative artificial intelligence (AI), particularly ChatGPT, gained attention for its potential to support medical practice. However, concerns remain about the reliability and consistency of its responses. This study systematically reviews the existing evidence on the role of generative AI in IBD.
Materials and methods
We conducted a systematic literature review following PRISMA guidelines. Studies investigating generative AI in IBD care were identified through PubMed and Embase (Jan 2020–Sep 2024).
Results
From 2875 records, 8 studies (2023–2024) met inclusion criteria: 5 on patient education, 2 on decision support, and 1 on research ideation. For patient education, ChatGPT provided clear and accurate responses, with accuracy reaching 84.2 % in a study, though sometimes lacked consistency. In decision support, ChatGPT’s classifications of ulcerative colitis severity aligned with clinician assessments in 80 % of cases and in 87.8 % of cases for guideline-based dysplasia management. For research ideation, ChatGPT generated highly relevant (mean score: 4.9 ± 0.26) and clear (4.8 ± 0.41) questions, but lacked specificity (2.86/5) and originality (1.07/5).
Conclusions
Generative AI shows promise in IBD care, but concerns about accuracy, consistency, and outdated information highlight the need for expert oversight before clinical integration.},

Drawing from one field study on the Facebook Ad platform and two experimental studies, we find that brand avoidance among tourists is reduced when tourism brands adopt AI-generated (vs. human-generated) moral content to support stigmatized dissociative out-groups. This effect is mediated by tourists' psychological proximity to these groups and is weakened for those with a strong sense of common fate with these out-groups. These insights contribute to tourism literature on generative AI and diversity, equity, and inclusivity while offering strategic guidance for brands seeking to embrace stigmatized groups.},

    abstract = {In recent years, there has been a significant improvement in the accuracy of the classification of pigmented skin lesions using artificial intelligence algorithms. Intelligent analysis and classification systems are significantly superior to visual diagnostic methods used by dermatologists and oncologists. However, the application of such systems in clinical practice is severely limited due to a lack of generalizability and risks of potential misclassification. Successful implementation of artificial intelligence-based tools into clinicopathological practice requires a comprehensive study of the effectiveness and performance of existing models, as well as further promising areas for potential research development. The purpose of this systematic review is to investigate and evaluate the accuracy of artificial intelligence technologies for detecting malignant forms of pigmented skin lesions. For the study, 10,589 scientific research and review articles were selected from electronic scientific publishers, of which 171 articles were included in the presented systematic review. All selected scientific articles are distributed according to the proposed neural network algorithms from machine learning to multimodal intelligent architectures and are described in the corresponding sections of the manuscript. This research aims to explore automated skin cancer recognition systems, from simple machine learning algorithms to multimodal ensemble systems based on advanced encoder-decoder models, visual transformers (ViT), and generative and spiking neural networks. In addition, as a result of the analysis, future directions of research, prospects, and potential for further development of automated neural network systems for classifying pigmented skin lesions are discussed.},

    abstract = {Aim
This systematic review assesses AI's application, effectiveness and impact on nursing education, while identifying research limitations.
Background
AI integration in nursing education is transforming traditional teaching and learning paradigms.
Design
A systematic review.
Methods
Following PRISMA 2020 guidelines, a search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane Library and CINAHL from the inception of the databases to November 1, 2024, focusing on "Artificial Intelligence" and "nursing education." Two reviewers independently screened and assessed the literature. The quality was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 (RoB-2) tool for randomized controlled trials (RCTs), the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) tools evaluation for observational studies and the JBI Critical Appraisal Checklist for quasi-experimental studies.
Results
Fifteen studies involving 1464 nursing students and professionals were included. The application scenarios of AI technology in nursing education are diverse and varied and it has shown significant potential in many areas of nursing education, but conflicting results have also been observed. Evaluation of literature quality showed that there were seven high-quality studies and eight medium-quality studies. Artificial intelligence was found to have a positive impact on students at three levels: learning attitude and psychological effects, learning effectiveness and comprehensive clinical nursing competencies. Key research gaps were identified, including the lack of longitudinal studies, uneven study populations and the lack of measurement instrument validity and objectivity.
Conclusion
AI positively impacts nursing education but requires further research to address gaps and ensure long-term effectiveness and privacy protection.

    abstract = {Purpose
This study aims to investigate the relevance, accuracy, specificity and justification of investment recommendations of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) chatbots for different investment capitals and countries (UK and Bulgaria).
Design/methodology/approach
A two-stage mixed methods approach was used. Prompts were queried into OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Microsoft Bing and Google Bard (now Gemini). Finance and investment practitioners and finance and investment lecturers assessed the chatbots’ recommendations through an online questionnaire using a five-point Likert scale. The Chi-squared test, Wilcoxon-signed ranks test, Mann–Whitney U test and Friedman test were used for data analysis to compare GenAIs’ recommendations for the UK and Bulgaria across different amounts of investment capital and to assess the consistency of the chatbots.
Findings
GenAI chatbots’ responses were found to perform medium-to-high in terms of relevance, accuracy, specificity and justification. For the UK sample, the amount of investment had a marginal effect but prompt timing had an interesting impact. Unlike the British sample, the GenAI application, prompt timing and investment amount did not significantly influence the Bulgarian respondents’ evaluations. While the mean responses of the British sample were slightly higher, these differences were not statistically significant, indicating that ChatGPT, Bing and Bard performed similarly in both the UK and Bulgaria.
Originality/value
The study assesses the relevance, accuracy, specificity and justification of GenAI chatbots’ investment recommendations for two different periods, investment amounts and countries.},

A comprehensive analysis is conducted on the growing impact of AI in educational management, assessing the possibility that it could replace the role of the educational director. Through a prospective approach and an exhaustive review of the scientific literature, the study examines how AI can transform the management of educational institutions by optimizing decision-making processes, enhancing administrative efficiency, and personalizing educational pathways through the analysis of large datasets. However, the intrinsic limitations of AI are highlighted, notably its inability to replicate essential human competencies such as empathy, intuition, inspiring leadership, and nuanced understanding of human interactions. Consequently, a hybrid leadership model is proposed, where AI acts as a high-performing assistant for routine tasks, while human educational directors focus on strategic and relational aspects. Thus, although AI offers significant advantages for educational management, it cannot entirely substitute for the indispensable role of the human educational director.},

    abstract = {Background
A substantial cohort of individuals rely on online resources, such as discussion forums, for support on tapering antidepressants. This study aimed to assess the performance of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in responding to clinical queries on tapering antidepressants.
Methods
Ten queries on tapering antidepressants were developed based on previous research, prescribing guidelines, and online peer support forums. Queries covered areas including reasons for discontinuing antidepressants, tapering methods, withdrawal symptoms, and relapse. Each query was submitted to ChatGPT (OpenAI, San Francisco, CA) using the GPT-4 model as an independent standalone query using standardised prompts. Responses were evaluated in terms of relevance, accuracy, completeness, and clarity by two researchers working independently.
Results
GPT-4 responses to all tapering queries were considered relevant and within scope. Most responses (8/10) incorporated safety netting by emphasising the importance of consulting healthcare professionals before making any medication changes. The overall accuracy, completeness, and clarity of responses compared less favourably. The response to a query on hyperbolic tapering had the least favourable assessment. This was due to inaccuracies as the response incorrectly referred to logarithmic reductions and provided inaccurate examples of fixed dosage reductions. Several instances of AI hallucinations were identified, including fabricated references.
Conclusion
Generative AI is having a transformative impact on healthcare, including how healthcare professionals and patients access information about clinical queries, such as antidepressant tapering. The study findings show that GPT-4 was able to provide relevant and safety-conscious responses on antidepressant tapering. However, performance issues such as inconsistencies and inaccuracies in tapering recommendations highlight the important role that healthcare professionals continue to play in providing patients with clinically trained, professional support in safely managing health-related issues. Further research on developing AI evaluation tools is needed to ensure consistency in the approaches used in evaluating the performance of AI in addressing clinical queries.},

    abstract = {Background
While artificial intelligence has significantly impacted medicine, the application of large language models (LLMs) in oral and maxillofacial surgery (OMS) remains underexplored.
Purpose
This study aimed to measure and compare the accuracy of 4 leading LLMs on OMS board examination questions and to identify specific areas for improvement.
Study Design, Setting, and Sample
An in-silico cross-sectional study was conducted to evaluate 4 artificial intelligence chatbots on 714 OMS board examination questions.
Predictor Variable
The predictor variable was the LLM used — LLM 1 (Generative Pretrained Transformer 4o [GPT-4o], OpenAI, San Francisco, CA), LLM 2 (Generative Pretrained Transformer 3.5 [GPT-3.5], OpenAI, San Francisco, CA), LLM 3 (Gemini, Google, Mountain View, CA), and LLM 4 (Copilot, Microsoft, Redmond, WA).
Main Outcome Variables
The primary outcome variable was accuracy, defined as the percentage of correct answers provided by each LLM. Secondary outcomes included the LLMs' ability to correct errors on subsequent attempts and their performance across 11 specific OMS subject domains: medicine and anesthesia, dentoalveolar and implant surgery, maxillofacial trauma, maxillofacial infections, maxillofacial pathology, salivary glands, oncology, maxillofacial reconstruction, temporomandibular joint anatomy and pathology, craniofacial and clefts, and orthognathic surgery.
Covariates
No additional covariates were considered.
Analyses
Statistical analysis included one-way ANOVA and post hoc Tukey honest significant difference (HSD) to compare performance across chatbots. χ2 tests were used to assess response consistency and error correction, with statistical significance set at P < .05.
Results
LLM 1 achieved the highest accuracy with an average score of 83.69%, statistically significantly outperforming LLM 3 (66.85%, P = .002), LLM 2 (64.83%, P = .001), and LLM 4 (62.18%, P < .001). Across the 11 OMS subject domains, LLM 1 consistently had the highest accuracy rates. LLM 1 also corrected 98.2% of errors, while LLM 2 corrected 93.44%, both statistically significantly higher than LLM 4 (29.26%) and LLM 3 (70.71%) (P < .001).
Conclusion and Relevance
LLM 1 (GPT-4o) significantly outperformed other models in both accuracy and error correction, indicating its strong potential as a tool for enhancing OMS education. However, the variability in performance across different domains highlights the need for ongoing refinement and continued evaluation to integrate these LLMs more effectively into the OMS field.},

This review includes peer-reviewed publications and conference proceedings in English, focusing on clinical studies of human periodontal diseases. Intraoral photographs served as the primary data source, with fluorescent and microscopic dental images excluded. The methodological characteristics and performance metrics of clinical studies reporting on AI models were analysed. Twenty-six studies met the review criteria. Various image acquisition devices were used by the resarchers including professional cameras, intraoral cameras, smartphones, and home-use devices. Ten studies used clinical examinations as reference methods, while 16 used visual examinations. Eight studies involved multiple experts in dataset annotation. Only 9 studies employed multiple intraoral views for their AI models, with the remaining studies focusing solely on the frontal view. Regarding AI tasks, 17 studies used classification, 4 used detection, and 5 used segmentations. Performance metrics varied widely and were assessed at multiple levels. Classification studies showed accuracies ranging from 0.46 to 1.00, detection studies showed accuracies from 0.56 to 0.78, and segmentation studies achieved Intersection over Union (IoU) scores of 0.43 to 0.70. AI models show potential for detecting periodontal disease from intraoral photographs, but their clinical use faces challenges. Future research should focus on improving reporting standards, standardising evaluation metrics, performing external tests, enhancing data quality, and using clinical gold standards as reference methods. Furthermore, efforts should focus on promoting transparency, integrating ethical considerations, minimising misclassification, and advancing the development of explainable and user-friendly AI systems to enhance their clinical applicability and reliability.},

First, the advantages of artificial intelligence-driven solutions in supply chain management are explored, especially in demand forecasting, inventory management, and warehouse process automation. These technologies provide real-time decision support by processing massive data, reducing inventory waste and improving logistics efficiency. Secondly, a supply chain optimization model based on genetic algorithm is constructed, and the objective function and constraints are clarified, covering key optimization goals such as cost minimization, profit maximization and service level improvement. The model continuously iterates and optimizes the supply chain configuration through the core operation steps of genetic algorithm, including population initialization, fitness evaluation, selection, crossover and mutation. The experimental results show that artificial intelligence technology and genetic algorithm can significantly reduce supply chain costs, improve logistics efficiency and enhance service levels, verifying the effectiveness of the model in practical applications.},

    abstract = {In this viewpoint article, our goal is to raise awareness and spark debate in the Information Systems (IS) community regarding a prominent concern that has important strategic and ethical implications: the environmental impact of the increasing use of generative artificial intelligence (GAI). We examine several specific issues, beginning with GAI’s heavy consumption of natural resources and electricity. We then move to assessing how the rich and the Global North gain via GAI, while the poor and the Global South must deal with its adverse effects. We then move to assessing GAI’s impact on underrepresented communities and countries in the Global South; while GAI contributes to global warming, this affects people unevenly, because it is mostly rich people and the Global North that make intensive use of these technologies. After suggesting that more local and global laws are needed to regulate the sustainable use of AI, we report on how organizations can perform AI strategizing, for instance to control emissions in smart cities and improve weather forecasting. We conclude with a research agenda that aims to encourage IS scholars to focus on the environmental impact of AI, its ethical implications for organizations, and how GAI can be used strategically to benefit all.},

    abstract = {Background
Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) is expected to enhance the productivity of the public social and health care sector while maintaining, at minimum, current standards of quality and user experience. However, empirical evidence on GAI impacts in practical, real-life settings remains limited.
Objective
This study investigates productivity, machine translation quality, and user experience impacts of the GPT-4 language model in an in-house language translation services team of a large well-being services county in Finland.
Methods
A mixed methods study was conducted with 4 in-house translators between March and June 2024. Quantitative data of 908 translation segments were collected in real-life conditions using the computer-assisted language translation software Trados (RWS) to assess productivity differences between machine and human translation. Quality was measured using 4 automatic metrics (human-targeted translation edit rate, Bilingual Evaluation Understudy, Metric for Evaluation of Translation With Explicit Ordering, and Character n-gram F-score) applied to 1373 GAI-human segment pairs. User experience was investigated through 5 semistructured interviews, including the team supervisor.
Results
The findings indicate that, on average, postediting machine translation is 14% faster than translating texts from scratch (2.75 vs 2.40 characters per second, P=.03), and up to 37% faster when the number of segments is equalized across translators. However, productivity varied notably between individuals, with improvements ranging from −2% to 102%. Regarding translation quality, 11% (141/1261) of Finnish-Swedish and 16% (18/112) of Finnish-English GAI outputs were accepted without edits. Average human-targeted translation edit rate scores were 55 (Swedish) and 46 (English), indicating that approximately half of the words required editing. Bilingual Evaluation Understudy scores averaged 43 for Swedish and 38 for English, suggesting good translation quality. Metric for Evaluation of Translation With Explicit Ordering and Character n-gram F-scores reached 63 and 68 for Swedish and 59 and 57 for English, respectively. All metrics have been converted to an equivalent scale from 0 to 100, with 100 reflecting a perfect match. Interviewed translators expressed mixed reviews on productivity gains but generally perceived value in using GAI, especially for repetitive, generic content. Identified challenges included inconsistent or incorrect terminology, lack of document-level context, and limited system customization.
Conclusions
Based on this case study, GPT-4–based GAI shows measurable potential to enhance translation productivity and quality within an in-house translation team in the public social and health care sector. However, its effectiveness appears to be influenced by factors, such as translator postediting skills, workflow design, and organizational readiness. These findings suggest that, in similar contexts, public social and health care organizations could benefit from investing in translator training, optimizing technical integration, redesigning workflows, and implementing effective change management. Future research should examine larger translator teams to assess the generalizability of these results and further explore how translation quality and user experience can be improved through domain-specific customization.},

    abstract = {Machine learning (ML) techniques are commonly seen as an inductive learning procedure, typically involving the identification of patterns in a specific training dataset to make predictions in novel contexts. By doing so, the performance and generalizability of these techniques often rely on the quality and quantity of the available training data. However, gathering a diverse training dataset that captures multiple nuances of students’ reasoning poses challenges in educational settings due to resource constraints. We compared three data augmentation strategies to address this issue: collecting additional student data, utilizing chatbots to paraphrase existing responses, and prompting chatbots to generate synthetic responses. We found that leveraging data augmentation significantly improved ML model performance. In detail, combining authentic and/or paraphrased responses with chatbot responses yielded the best machine-human score agreements across various validation conditions. This data augmentation allowed us to expand our applied scoring rubric by introducing a more detailed categorization that better captured the level of causality in undergraduate chemistry students’ reasoning about reaction mechanisms. Together, these findings highlight effective possibilities for augmenting the size and heterogeneity of the training data to improve ML model performance and generalizability, introduce a more fine-grained categorization, and reduce human effort in data collection. In the future, these benefits may enhance the scalability of formative assessments that adaptively support students’ reasoning in postsecondary chemistry classes.},

@article{MARTIN2025,
    abstract = {Background
There is ample evidence that the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) tools into nursing practice is becoming more commonplace, but there are fewer national resources indicating to what degree prelicensure nursing programs employ these technologies and incorporate related topics into their curriculum.
Purpose
The current survey study sought to determine the prevalence of registered nurse (RN) and licensed practical nurse (LPN) education programs’ use of generative AI technologies, and the extent to which they embed AI and other digital health topics into their instructional content.
Methods
A national survey was conducted of all RN and LPN program administrators nationwide for which we had email contact information (N = 2744).
Results
Prelicensure RN programs (n = 122, 24 %) were more likely to use generative AI technology than LPN programs (n = 27, 12 %, p < 0.001), but more than three-quarters of both types of programs reported they do not use such tools or are not sure. In addition to the low usage of generative AI technology, few programs reported teaching advancements in AI and/or other digital health–related topics to their students (RN n = 87, 17 %; LPN n = 25, 11 %).
Conclusion
Nursing education programs that limit integration of AI into their curriculum risk potentially limiting students’ learning on evidence-based practice and may miss opportunities to promote critical reflection. The results of our study underscore the need to support nursing faculty to ensure prelicensure instructional content prepares nursing students for advancements in clinical practice.},

@article{MATHESON2025,
    abstract = {Rationale and Objectives
Hyperpolarized 129Xenon magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures the extent of lung ventilation by ventilation defect percent (VDP), but VDP alone cannot distinguish between diseases. Prior studies have reported anecdotal evidence of disease-specific defect patterns such as wedge-shaped defects in asthma and polka-dot defects in lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM). Neural network artificial intelligence can evaluate image shapes and textures to classify images, but this has not been attempted in xenon MRI. We hypothesized that an artificial intelligence network trained on ventilation MRI could classify diseases based on spatial patterns in lung MR images alone.
Materials and Methods
Xenon MRI data in six pulmonary conditions (control, asthma, bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, cystic fibrosis, LAM) were used to train convolutional neural networks. Network performance was assessed with top-1 and top-2 accuracy, recall, precision, and one-versus-all area under the curve (AUC). Gradient class-activation-mapping (Grad-CAM) was used to visualize what parts of the images were important for classification.
Results
Training/testing data were collected from 262 participants. The top performing network (VGG-16) had top-1 accuracy=56%, top-2 accuracy=78%, recall=.30, precision=.70, and AUC=.85. The network performed better on larger classes (top-1 accuracy: control=62% [n=57], CF=67% [n=85], LAM=69% [n=61]) and outperformed human observers (human top-1 accuracy=40%, network top-1 accuracy=61% on a single training fold).
Conclusion
We developed an artificial intelligence tool that could classify disease from xenon ventilation images alone that outperformed human observers. This suggests that xenon images have additional, disease-specific information that could be useful for cases that are clinically challenging or for disease phenotyping.},

Rapid advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) are leading to the proliferation of health applications. AI presents both opportunities and risks for migrants, including refugees, and asylum-seekers. This Personal View provides a critical perspective on opportunities and risks of using AI in migrant health. It synthesises literature insights to highlight the potential health benefits of AI, for both the general population and migrants, in areas including information retrieval, translation, education, empowerment, disease prevention and diagnosis, and personalised treatments. It addresses risks posed by AI, including the potential for tracking and monitoring individuals, which could threaten the anonymity and freedom of those using digital services, as well as the perpetuation or exacerbation of biases in the algorithms used. Current deficiencies in AI, including issues of quality and tendencies to sometimes invent data, as well as to reinforce existing biases and discriminatory processes, may also adversely impact on various groups of migrants coming from different parts of the world, compounding existing ethical challenges. Given the high level of digital infrastructure and opportunities for coherent policy-making and regulatory control within the region, Europe can provide leadership in developing guidelines, policies and agreements ensuring that AI serves migrants' health needs while not compromising their rights.},

This paper presents an analysis of documents produced by 116 US universities classified as as high research activity or R1 institutions providing a comprehensive examination of the advice and guidance offered by institutional stakeholders about GenAI. Through an extensive analysis, we found a majority of universities (N = 73, 63%) encourage the use of GenAI, with many offering detailed guidance for its use in the classroom (N = 48, 41%). Over half the institutions provided sample syllabi (N = 65, 56%) and half (N = 58, 50%) provided sample GenAI curriculum and activities that would help instructors integrate and leverage GenAI in their teaching. Notably, the majority of guidance focused on writing activities focused on writing, whereas references to code and STEM-related activities were infrequent, and often vague, even when mentioned (N = 58, 50%). Finally, more than half of institutions talked about the ethics of GenAI on a broad range of topics, including Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) (N = 60, 52%). Based on our findings we caution that guidance for faculty can become burdensome as policies suggest or imply substantial revisions to existing pedagogical practices.},

The graph representation encodes structural elements as edges and their connections as nodes, maintaining critical dimensional constraints and spatial relationships. Using data from bamboo stilt houses built without architects, we make a specialized dataset of geometric skeletons for model training. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in capturing the distribution of featured elements in building frameworks and in generating structurally sound designs, with GraphSAGE showing better performance compared to alternative methods. The probabilistic edge prediction approach allows for a collaborative human-AI design process, empowering designers while utilizing computational capabilities.

This paper describes what AI tools have become available since the beginning of the ChatGPT revolution and contemplates how it they might change physicians’ perceptions about this breakthrough technology.},

    abstract = {Synthetic visual art is becoming a commodity due to generative artificial intelligence (AI). The trend of using AI for co-creation will not spare artists’ creative processes, and it is important to understand how the use of generative AI at different stages of the creative process affects both the evaluation of the artist and the result of the human-machine collaboration (i.e., the visual artifact). In three experiments (N = 560), this research explores how the evaluation of artworks is transformed by the revelation that the artist collaborated with AI at different stages of the creative process. The results show that co-created art is less liked and recognized, especially when AI was used in the implementation stage. While co-created art is perceived as more novel, it lacks creative authenticity, which exerts a dominant influence. The results also show that artists’ perceptions suffer from the co-creation process, and that artists who co-create are less admired because they are perceived as less authentic. Two boundary conditions are identified. The negative effect can be mitigated by disclosing the level of artist involvement in co-creation with AI (e.g., by training the algorithm on a curated set of images vs. simply prompting an off-the-shelf AI image generator). In the context of art that is perceived as commercially motivated (e.g., stock images), the effect is also diminished. This research has important implications for the literature on human-AI-collaboration, research on authenticity, and the ongoing policy debate regarding the transparency of algorithmic presence.},

Therefore, this research investigates how people react to biased GAI-content based on their pre-existing political beliefs and how this influences the acceptance of GAI. In three experiments (N = 513), it was found that perceived alignment between user's political orientation and bias in generated content (in text and images) increases acceptance and reliance on GAI. Participants who perceived alignment were more likely to grant GAI access to sensitive smartphone functions and to endorse the use in critical domains (e.g., loan approval; social media moderation). Because users see GAI as a social actor, they consider perceived alignment as a sign of greater objectivity, thus granting aligned GAI access to more sensitive areas.},

    abstract = {Summary
Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping infectious disease diagnostics by supporting clinical decision making, optimising laboratory and clinical workflows, and enabling real-time disease surveillance. AI approaches improve pathogen detection, antimicrobial stewardship, and treatment monitoring, enhancing diagnostic accuracy, efficiency, and scalability. The role of AI in combating antimicrobial resistance is particularly significant, enabling rapid pathogen identification and personalised treatment. Despite progress over the past two decades, widespread AI adoption in infectious disease diagnostics faces challenges. In high-income countries, fragmented data ecosystems, incomplete datasets, and algorithmic bias hinder clinical integration. Meanwhile, low-income and middle-income countries contend with limited digital infrastructure, unstandardised data, and financial constraints, exacerbating disparities in diagnostic access. Further barriers include concerns over interoperability, data privacy, cybersecurity, and the regulation of AI implementation. This paper examines the role of AI in infectious disease diagnostics, highlighting both opportunities and limitations. It underscores the need for coordinated investments in digital infrastructure, harmonised data-sharing frameworks, and clinician engagement to support equitable, sustainable adoption. Addressing these challenges will enable health-care systems to harness the potential of AI to improve infectious disease detection, prevention, and management of infectious diseases, thereby strengthening global health resilience.},

A productive conversation about AI requires the conversation to recognize AI as a very broad and diverse field with “narrow” and “general” applications. Narrow AI applications are quite common and widely deployed today. A fearless conversation can be had regarding how narrow AI can be more widely adopted while allowing for increased transparency and comfort. General AI is more complex and generally leads to what level of government regulation may be necessary (if practically possible).

Notably, there has been an increase in interest in using artificial intelligence, particularly generative AI, in the pharmacovigilance of pharmaceuticals under development, as well as those already in the market. This review was conducted to understand how generative AI can play an important role in pharmacovigilance and improving drug safety monitoring. Data from previously published articles and news items were reviewed in order to obtain information. We used PubMed and Google Scholar as our search engines, and keywords (pharmacovigilance, artificial intelligence, machine learning, drug safety, and patient safety) were used. In toto, we reviewed 109 articles published till 31st January 2024, and the obtained information was interpreted, compiled, evaluated, and conclusions were reached. Generative AI has transformative potential in pharmacovigilance, showcasing benefits, such as enhanced adverse event detection, data-driven risk prediction, and optimized drug development. By making it easier to process and analyze big datasets, generative artificial intelligence has applications across a variety of disease states. Machine learning and automation in this field can streamline pharmacovigilance procedures and provide a more efficient way to assess safety-related data. Nevertheless, more investigation is required to determine how this optimization affects the caliber of safety analyses. In the near future, the increased utilization of artificial intelligence is anticipated, especially in predicting side effects and Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs).},

@article{MIZUKAMI2026100906,
    abstract = {Purpose
Accurate evaluation of anterior chamber depth (ACD), a major risk factor for angle closure, is clinically important. Although standard techniques provide reliable measurements, they are often labor-intensive, technically demanding, and time-consuming. To address this, we previously developed an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm capable of estimating ACD from slit lamp photographs. This study sought to assess the performance of this AI model when applied via the Smart Eye Camera (SEC), a smartphone-compatible slit lamp imaging system, by comparing its estimates to those obtained with anterior segment OCT (AS-OCT) at a separate institution.
Design
An evaluation of diagnostic test.
Participants
Five hundred fifty-six phakic eyes (268 nondilated and 288 dilated eyes) from 329 Asian patients.
Methods
A retrospective analysis was performed on images captured using both the SEC and AS-OCT. Anterior chamber depth values generated by the AI model embedded in the SEC were compared with corresponding measurements obtained using AS-OCT.
Main Outcome Measures
Metrics, including mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), Pearson correlation coefficient, and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), were calculated to evaluate model performance.
Results
The AI algorithm integrated into the SEC demonstrated the capability to estimate the ACD with an MAE of 0.119 ± 0.0949 mm and an MSE of 0.0233 ± 0.0557 mm. A strong correlation was observed between ACD measurements obtained using AS-OCT and those estimated by AI (R = 0.922; 95% confidence interval, 0.908–0.933). The ICC for agreement between AI-estimated and AS-OCT-measured ACD was 0.903, indicating excellent reliability.
Conclusions
Our AI model, embedded within the SEC platform, demonstrated high accuracy in estimating ACD when benchmarked against AS-OCT. Given its portability and user-friendliness, the SEC presents a promising option for accessible ACD screening across diverse clinical environments.

Diabetes remains a major global health challenge in China. Artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated considerable potential in improving diabetes management. This study aimed to assess healthcare providers’ perceptions regarding AI in diabetes care across China.
Methods
A cross-sectional survey was conducted using snowball sampling from November 12 to November 24, 2024. We selected 514 physicians and nurses by a snowball sampling method from healthcare providers across 30 cities or provinces in China. The self-developed questionnaire comprised five sections with 19 questions assessing medical workers’ demographic characteristics, AI-related experience and interest, awareness, attitudes, and concerns regarding AI in diabetes care. Statistical analysis was performed using t-test, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and linear regression.
Results
Among them, 20.0 % and 48.1 % of respondents had participated in AI-related research and training, while 85.4 % expressed moderate to high interest in AI training for diabetes care. Most respondents reported partial awareness of AI in diabetes care, and only 12.6 % exhibited a comprehensive or substantial understanding. Attitudes toward AI in diabetes care were generally positive, with a mean score of 24.50 ± 3.38. Nurses demonstrated significantly higher scores than physicians (P < 0.05). Greater awareness, prior AI training experience, and higher interest in AI training in diabetes care were strongly associated with more positive attitudes (P < 0.05). Key concerns regarding AI included trust issues from AI-clinician inconsistencies (77.2 %), increased workload and clinical workflow disruptions (63.4 %), and incomplete legal and regulatory frameworks (60.3 %). Only 34.2 % of respondents expressed concerns about job displacement, indicating general confidence in their professional roles.
Conclusions
While Chinese healthcare providers show moderate awareness of AI in diabetes care, their attitudes are generally positive, and they are considerably interested in future training. Tailored, role-specific AI training is essential for equitable and effective integration into clinical practice. Additionally, transparent, reliable, ethical AI models must be prioritized to alleviate practitioners’ concerns.},

This study systematically evaluates the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in cochlear implant (CI) technology, focusing on speech enhancement, automated fitting, AI-assisted surgery, predictive modeling, and rehabilitation. The review identifies key advancements, existing limitations, and areas for future development.
Methods
Following PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a systematic search across PubMed, IEEE Xplore, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and Embase. We included peer-reviewed primary data studies on AI applications in CIs. The selected studies were categorized into thematic subdomains, such as noise suppression, adaptive programming, AI-driven surgical planning, and telemedicine applications.
Results
From an initial pool of 743 records, 129 studies met the eligibility criteria and were included in the final analysis. These studies were categorized into eleven thematic subdomains. The review identified the main application areas and emerging research fronts at the intersection of artificial intelligence and cochlear implant technologies, including speech enhancement, automated fitting, predictive modeling, rehabilitation support, and AI-assisted surgery.
Discussion and Conclusion
AI is transforming CI technology by improving speech perception, personalization, and surgical precision. However, challenges persist, including computational constraints, data heterogeneity, and the need for large-scale clinical validation. Future research should prioritize energy-efficient AI architectures, regulatory approval pathways, and ethical considerations in automated decision-making. Advancing AI-driven telemedicine solutions can expand CI accessibility, reducing the need for in-person programming. Addressing these challenges will accelerate the development of more adaptive and user-centered CI solutions, ultimately enhancing auditory rehabilitation and quality of life for CI users.},

    abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) presents novel approaches to enhance motivation, curriculum structure and development, and learning and retrieval processes for both learners and instructors. Though a focus for this emerging technology is academic misconduct, we sought to leverage GenAI in curriculum structure to facilitate educational outcomes. For instructors, GenAI offers new opportunities in course design and management while reducing time requirements to evaluate outcomes and personalizing learner feedback. These include innovative instructional designs such as flipped classrooms and gamification, enriching teaching methodologies with focused and interactive approaches, and team-based exercise development among others. For learners, GenAI offers unprecedented self-directed learning opportunities, improved cognitive engagement, and effective retrieval practices, leading to enhanced autonomy, motivation, and knowledge retention. Though empowering, this evolving landscape has integration challenges and ethical considerations, including accuracy, technological evolution, loss of learner’s voice, and socioeconomic disparities. Our experience demonstrates that the responsible application of GenAI’s in educational settings will revolutionize learning practices, making education more accessible and tailored, producing positive motivational outcomes for both learners and instructors. Thus, we argue that leveraging GenAI in educational settings will improve outcomes with implications extending from primary through higher and continuing education paradigms.},

In this article we present a dataset collected for examining social and political attitudes of the Spanish population. We obtained participants’ responses through a research company using an online survey. The sample was stratified by quotas following the distribution of the Spanish population. All participants received an economic compensation for their participation. The dataset featured in this article contains data of 1,541 participants on support for technocracy of artificial intelligence (AI), subjective socioeconomic status, political orientation, and other related variables such as financial threat, financial scarcity, perceived socioeconomic decline, perceived economic inequality, and relative deprivation. The survey also collected sociodemographic data. Importantly, these data were collected during a period of political elections in some regions of Spain. This is the first dataset on support for technocracy of AI and social and political attitudes that may shape it in current societies. It is proposed to consider this dataset as a help to clarify and examine the relationship between the perception of economic situation and support for an AI technocracy. This data publication could offer new perspectives for addressing current political and economic challenges, proposing solutions based on data and the potential factors that foster trust in AI as a part of government.},

    abstract = {Introduction
Generative artificial intelligence (Gen-AI), exemplified by the widely adopted ChatGPT, has garnered significant attention in recent years. Its application spans various health education domains, including pharmacy, where its potential benefits and drawbacks have become increasingly apparent. Despite the growing adoption of Gen-AI such as ChatGPT in pharmacy education, there remains a critical need to assess and mitigate associated risks. This review exploresthe literature and potential strategies for mitigating risks associated with the integration of Gen-AI in pharmacy education.
Aim
To conduct a scoping review to identify implications of Gen-AI in pharmacy education, identify its use and emerging evidence, with a particular focus on strategies which mitigate potential risks to academic integrity.
Methods
A scoping review strategy was employed in accordance with the PRISMA-ScR guidelines. Databases searched includedPubMed, ERIC [Education Resources Information Center], Scopus and ProQuestfrom August 2023 to 20 February 2024 and included all relevant records from 1 January 2000 to 20 February 2024 relating specifically to LLM use within pharmacy education. A grey literature search was also conducted due to the emerging nature of this topic. Policies, procedures, and documents from institutions such as universities and colleges, including standards, guidelines, and policy documents, were hand searched and reviewed in their most updated form. These documents were not published in the scientific literature or indexed in academic search engines.
Results
Articles (n = 12) were derived from the scientific data bases and Records (n = 9) derived from the grey literature. Potential use and benefits of Gen-AI within pharmacy education were identified in all included published articles however there was a paucity of published articles related the degree of consideration to the potential risks to academic integrity. Grey literature recordsheld the largest proportion of risk mitigation strategies largely focusing on increased academic and student education and training relating to the ethical use of Gen-AI as well considerations for redesigning of current assessments likely to be a risk for Gen-AI use to academic integrity.
Conclusion
Drawing upon existing literature, this review highlights the importance of evidence-based approaches to address the challenges posed by Gen-AI such as ChatGPT in pharmacy education settings. Additionally, whilst mitigation strategies are suggested, primarily drawn from the grey literature, there is a paucity of traditionally published scientific literature outlining strategies for the practical and ethical implementation of Gen-AI within pharmacy education. Further research related to the responsible and ethical use of Gen-AI in pharmacy curricula; and studies related to strategies adopted to mitigate risks to academic integrity would be beneficial.},

    abstract = {High inflation is causing major manufacturing cost increases, making optimizing production lines a priority in Industry 5.0 manufacturing. As a result, there has been a rising interest in reducing these costs by more efficiently optimizing production, maintenance, and quality costs. This can be accomplished in manufacturing systems by integrating production task and maintenance activity scheduling, predictive maintenance, and quality control, with the application of artificial intelligence, information integration, and interoperability techniques. Accordingly, the present paper’s premise is to perform a literature review regarding production, maintenance, and quality integration in manufacturing environments. It aims to answer the main research question: “What are the current state-of-the-art artificial intelligence techniques applied in production/maintenance scheduling, predictive maintenance, and quality control integration?”. To investigate this, a Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)-like methodology is followed to find the most efficient, reliable, and robust artificial intelligence techniques for production, maintenance, and quality optimization in production lines. Results show that Genetic Algorithms, Reinforcement Learning, Artificial Neural Networks, and Random Forests are among the most often used algorithms in the literature. Furthermore, integration between production/maintenance scheduling and predictive maintenance is done primarily through the rescheduling of production plans when a machine failure is detected. In addition, the same system employed for predictive maintenance is often integrated into also predicting product quality. However, while there have been some accomplishments in this field, research that considers full production, maintenance, and quality integration is still lacking, even if there is an increasing trend of research on this topic.},

Recent empirical studies in sensory and consumer science highlight the potential utility of GenAI in, for example, AI-generated food images and recipes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to propose a comprehensive framework for integrating GenAI into research and development in sensory and consumer science. The framework highlights how GenAI can be applied across the concept, design, and testing phases through an iterative process. The concept phase utilises GenAI to generate research concepts (e.g., proposing ideas such as research questions and hypotheses). The design phase employs GenAI to formulate research designs. During this stage, GenAI assists with creating and validating survey/experimental stimuli and measurement scales. The testing phase applies GenAI to evaluate research ideas and designs by employing “silicon samples,” interactive surveys that enhance engagement and response quality. In the testing phase, GenAI can also analyse unstructured text data, offering more accurate and scalable text analysis than traditional methods, even across diverse languages and cultures. This study also acknowledges potential pitfalls, such as biases in AI outputs, data privacy and security concerns, oversimplification, lack of transparency, and GenAI user misperception.

When AI-generated summaries are at the forefront without allowing users to opt out, their search experience becomes less user-driven and more system-controlled. Yet, its impact on consumer switching intentions is underexplored. Grounded in consumer empowerment and psychological reactance theories, this mixed-method research investigates how the lack of a choice feature to opt out of AI integration drives consumer switching intentions. Analyzing real-world discussions on Reddit, followed by an experiment, our findings reveal that when users lack the choice to disable AI-generated content, they feel less empowered, more intrusive, and irritated, increasing their likelihood of switching. Our findings extend interface design literature by identifying “choice to opt out of AI feature” as a critical design element for GenAI interfaces. While previous research has primarily theorized consumer empowerment in AI-enabled interfaces by focusing on autonomy, power, and control, our findings advance this literature by empirically demonstrating consumer choice as a novel and critical antecedent of empowerment. Further, we contribute to psychological reactance theory by extending it to a permanent, system-level disruption and demonstrate that the scale and permanence of reactance drive switching intentions. We provide actionable recommendations for interface designers to incorporate a toggle switch into GenAI interfaces, enabling users to choose to disable AI features. It suggests that managers may use empowerment as a strategic differentiator of interfaces to prevent consumers from migrating to alternative interfaces.},

However, the rapid advancement and adoption of GenAI has left organizations with severe knowledge and skills gaps. In this study, we conduct a succinct review of GenAI’s impact on supply chains. Thereafter we draw upon strategic management theories and organizational change theories to develop an organizational GenAI action model to enable supply chain organizations to transition workers from a state of “unconscious GenAI incompetence” to “conscious GenAI competence,” working through the five stages of the model: getting urgent, exploration, formulation, iteration, and embedding. We will predominantly draw upon high-impact peer-reviewed articles, complemented by relevant gray literature, including the European Commission publications, in developing this review and conceptual model. We will close by highlighting the model’s applicability and future research directions.},

    abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing antimicrobial drug discovery by delivering major improvements in precision, innovation, and efficiency for combating bacterial, fungal, and viral pathogens. Traditional approaches to developing treatments for microbial infections are often hampered by high costs, lengthy timelines, and frequent failures. Modern AI technologies, particularly deep learning, machine learning, computational biology, and big data analytics, provide robust solutions to these challenges by analyzing large-scale biological datasets to predict molecular interactions, identify promising treatment candidates, and expedite both preclinical and clinical development. Innovative techniques such as generative adversarial networks for novel compound discovery, reinforcement learning for optimizing antimicrobial candidates, and natural language processing for extracting knowledge from biomedical literature are now vital to infectious disease research. These approaches facilitate early toxicity prediction, microbial target identification, virtual screening, and the development of more individualized therapies. Notwithstanding these advances, challenges remain, including inconsistent data quality, limited interpretability, and unresolved ethical or legal concerns. This review examines recent advancements in AI applications for microbial drug discovery, with a focus on de novo molecular design, ligand- and structure-based screening, and AI-enabled biomarker identification. Remaining application barriers and promising future directions in AI-driven antimicrobial drug development are also elucidated. Collectively, these innovations are poised to accelerate the discovery of new therapies, reduce costs, and enhance patient outcomes in the fight against infectious diseases.},

    abstract = {Purpose
The 2021 edition of the Artificial Intelligence Data Challenge was organized by the French Society of Radiology together with the Centre National d’Études Spatiales and CentraleSupélec with the aim to implement generative adversarial networks (GANs) techniques to provide 1000 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) cases of macrotrabecular-massive (MTM) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a rare and aggressive subtype of HCC, generated from a limited number of real cases from multiple French centers.
Materials and methods
A dedicated platform was used by the seven inclusion centers to securely upload their anonymized MRI examinations including all three cross-sectional images (one late arterial and one portal-venous phase T1-weighted images and one fat-saturated T2-weighted image) in compliance with general data protection regulation. The quality of the database was checked by experts and manual delineation of the lesions was performed by the expert radiologists involved in each center. Multidisciplinary teams competed between October 11th, 2021 and February 13th, 2022.
Results
A total of 91 MTM-HCC datasets of three images each were collected from seven French academic centers. Six teams with a total of 28 individuals participated in this challenge. Each participating team was asked to generate one thousand 3-image cases. The qualitative evaluation was performed by three radiologists using the Likert scale on ten randomly selected cases generated by each participant. A quantitative evaluation was also performed using two metrics, the Frechet inception distance and a leave-one-out accuracy of a 1-Nearest Neighbor algorithm.
Conclusion
This data challenge demonstrates the ability of GANs techniques to generate a large number of images from a small sample of imaging examinations of a rare malignant tumor.},

    abstract = {Objective
This pilot study explored the effectiveness of a student-led faculty development series by evaluating two key outcomes: the capacity of students to deliver meaningful professional development sessions to faculty and the impact of these sessions on faculty perceptions of generative artificial intelligence (AI).
Methods
In a flipped classroom model, two pharmacy students and 12 faculty members engaged in a semester-long learning series on AI. Each week, students presented on a selected topic followed by discussions that facilitated self-directed learning, including decision-making and project management. Faculty perceptions of AI were evaluated before and after the series using an anonymous survey tool (Technology Acceptance Model Edited to Assess ChatGPT Adoption, TAME-ChatGPT). Respondents created a self-chosen code to link their responses. Additionally, students completed a questionnaire to gauge their reflective thinking after the series.
Results
Faculty participation averaged 7 members per session. Twelve faculty completed the pre-survey, while 8 faculty completed the post-survey. Among those who had used ChatGPT (n = 4 pre [33 %], n = 2 post [25 %]), scores for usefulness increased, while concerns about risks decreased. In contrast, faculty who had not used ChatGPT (n = 8 pre [67 %], n = 6 post [75 %]) reported unchanged or improved scores for ease of use and reduced anxiety. Both students responded positively to the reflective thinking questionnaire.
Conclusion
This pilot study demonstrated that a student-led faculty learning series effectively fostered mutual collaborative learning, benefiting both faculty and students. Pharmacy students, often an underutilized resource, can play a valuable role in faculty development. Colleges of pharmacy may enhance faculty engagement by integrating student-led initiatives into their programs.},

    abstract = {Objective
The current study assessed pharmacy students' perceptions about generative AI before and after participation in a ChatGPT-based drug information activity.
Methods
In 2024, students at three colleges of pharmacy completed a baseline and post-activity survey on their perceptions of ChatGPT including its reliability, usefulness, and impact on academic performance and critical thinking. The survey was modified from the TAME-ChatGPT assessment and used a 5-point Likert scale. After the baseline survey, students answered clinically relevant drug information questions on their own using primary or tertiary resources and compared their answers with ChatGPT responses. Independent t-test samples were used to compare baseline and post-activity surveys.
Results
A total of 227 students completed the pre-survey and 203 students completed the post-survey. Students' concerns about the reliability of ChatGPT increased after completing the drug information activity (pre-survey: 3.57 ± 0.96; post-survey: 3.88 ± 1.11; p = 0.002). Students' concerns about reliance on ChatGPT and prevention of critical thinking increased (pre-survey: 3.30 ± 1.34; post-survey: 3.57 ± 1.21; p = 0.031). The following areas decreased after the activity: enthusiasm about ChatGPT as learning and research tool (pre-survey: 3.60 ± 1.02; post-survey: 3.32 ± 1.18; p = 0.008), viewing ChatGPT as an important tool for academic success (pre-survey: 3.40 ± 1.13; post-survey: 3.12 ± 1.23; p = 0.015), and concern regarding being accused of plagiarism when using ChatGPT(pre-survey: 4.12 ± 0.96; post-survey: 3.91 ± 1.10; p = 0.031). Open-ended responses revealed that students largely perceived ChatGPT as unreliable for drug information, citing concerns about accuracy and outdated content. However, some students noted its potential usefulness for non-clinical tasks such as generating ideas, organizing content, or providing general overviews.
Conclusion
After a hands-on ChatGPT-based drug information activity, pharmacy students reported increased concerns about reliability and over-reliance on artificial intelligence-based technology. The results of this study may encourage pharmacy educators to implement classroom activities for active exploration of the benefits and challenges of generative AI.
Contribution to literature
Limited published data describes pharmacy student perceptions of artificial intelligence platforms as a drug information source. There is even less literature with pre- and post-data after implementing an activity in which students gain hands-on experience critiquing an artificial intelligence platform response. Therefore, this study was conducted to evaluate student perceptions after using ChatGPT in the classroom and comparing its performance to their own responses based on information from primary and tertiary literature. The results demonstrate that despite enthusiasm before using ChatGPT, concerns for reliability and hindering thinking increased after a observing the limitations of its performance in answering drug information questions.},

    abstract = {Cell-free systems let researchers carry out biological processes like protein synthesis and metabolism without using living cells. This approach has become increasingly important in synthetic biology because it allows for quick testing of ideas, running many experiments simultaneously, and maintaining tight control over reaction conditions. The main challenge has been figuring out how to optimize these systems, since there are so many variables that interact in unpredictable ways. Artificial intelligence (AI), including machine learning, deep learning, and generative models, has begun to tackle this problem by helping predict experimental outcomes, design new proteins, and find better reaction conditions. The discovery of antimicrobial peptides through deep learning and cell-free protein synthesis, along with a 34-fold increase in protein yield through buffer optimization guided by active learning, are some of the major advancements made possible. The use of Bayesian optimization and neural networks has helped to streamline metabolic pathway designing, enzyme engineering as well as yield prediction, which in turn has diversified the use of AI-driven approaches in biomanufacturing, pharmaceuticals, and diagnostics. In spite of hurdles like data requirements, model transferability, and scalability, the compatibility of AI and cell-free systems gives adequate probabilities of innovations like digital twins and self-driven biomanufacturing units. This chapter explores the integration of AI with cell-free systems, focusing on recent advances, industrial applications, and ending with future directions for synthetic biology.},

    abstract = {Background
Recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in large language models, have shown promise in various fields, including health care. However, their performance on specialized medical board examinations, such as interventional cardiology assessments, remains relatively unexplored.
Methods
A cross-sectional study was conducted using a data set comprising 360 questions from the Cath Self Assessment Program (CathSAP) question bank. This study aimed to assess the overall performance of Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) and compare it to that of average test takers. Additionally, the study evaluated the impact of pertinent educational materials on ChatGPT’s responses, both before and after exposure. The primary outcome measures included ChatGPT’s overall percentage score on the CathSAP examination and its performance across various subsections. Statistical significance was determined using the Kruskal-Wallis equality-of-populations rank test.
Results
Initially, ChatGPT achieved an overall score of 54.44% on the CathSAP exam, which improved significantly to 79.16% after exposure to relevant textual content. The improvement was statistically significant (P = .0003). Notably, the improved score was comparable with the average score achieved by typical test takers (as reported by CathSAP). ChatGPT demonstrated proficiency in sections covering basic science, pharmacology, and miscellaneous topics, although it struggled with anatomy, anatomic variants, and anatomic pathology questions.
Conclusions
The study demonstrates ChatGPT’s potential for learning and adapting to medical examination scenarios, with a notable enhancement in performance after exposure to educational materials. However, limitations such as the model’s inability to process certain visual materials and potential biases in AI models warrant further consideration. These findings underscore the need for continued research to optimize the use of AI in medical education and assessment.},

Nonetheless, by leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI), India can chase the United Nations' 2030 target. A major obstacle impeding India's initiatives is the stigma associated with TB. Although there has always been a stigma associated with TB, it is the socio-cultural underpinnings of TB which are particularly concerning. Beyond deterring patients from seeking medical help, stigma manifests into numerous repercussions-for instance, patients resort to their own problematic solutions which further worsen the disease. In cases where patients do seek medical care, they often fail to repose trust in caregivers, pay lesser attention to doctor's advice and do not turn up for follow-up appointments, thereby increasing the chances of recurrence. Here, AI can be a gamechanger. It can facilitate stigma mitigation and simultaneously provide treatment to the patient without apparent human intervention. With AI-integration, professional medical help can be delivered to patients via mobile Applications. Nonetheless, the burgeoning AI led technological developments have spurred a spectrum of ethical and legal concerns which require a critical examination. The judicious use of AI in healthcare warrants its deployment to augment human expertise rather than to replace or supplant it.

For each stage, the guide offers examples and best practices while emphasizing that AI-generated content should always serve as a starting point, not a final product, and must be reviewed and verified using credible sources. Potential risks such as hallucinated outputs, embedded bias, and ethical challenges are discussed, particularly in culturally sensitive contexts. Transparency in GenAI chatbot use and researcher accountability are emphasized as essential principles. While GenAI chatbots can expand access to research support and foster innovation in TCIM, they cannot substitute for critical thinking, methodological rigour, or domain-specific expertise. Used responsibly, GenAI chatbots can augment human judgment and contribute meaningfully to the evolution of TCIM scholarship.},

    abstract = {Purpose
This paper aims to explore the initial formation of organizing visions within digital platforms regarding the use of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) in education. It examines how these emerging visions align with official guidelines. Understanding the early development of these organizing visions and the consensus formation around official guidelines for GAI in education has significant research and practical implications.
Design/methodology/approach
The present study uses a multimethodological approach with qualitative content-coding and inductive thematic analysis of digital trace data from the social media platform X and deductive thematic analysis of guideline documents. It first examines organizing visions within digital platforms through 1,260 tweets, focusing on opportunities and challenges posed by GAI, particularly ChatGPT, in educational settings. The study then analyses practical guidelines from international organizations, governments, and universities.
Findings
The empirical findings demonstrate that, although all three Organizing Vision (OV) functions are present in the early development of OVs for GAI in education, early-stage online discourse predominantly emphasizes the legitimation function. The findings also indicate a noticeable alignment between the topics discussed in the early development of OVs for GAI in education and the official guidelines and policies issued by international organizations, governments, and universities worldwide, indicating the need for educational reform, and ethical considerations.
Originality/value
This study contributes to the existing literature on the emergence of OVs in digital platforms by examining the context of GAI in education. This study also provides insights into the collective stance and recommendations from various authoritative sources, offering a comprehensive perspective on early-stage GAI policy development in an educational context.},

However, fully depicting the vast mosaic of concepts and applications in environmental sciences and ecology often entails a substantial workload. New Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools present an attractive option for addressing this challenge but require sufficient validation to match the vigorous standards of a systematic review. This article demonstrates the use of generative AI in the selection of relevant literature as part of a systematic review on indicators of ecosystem condition. We highlight, through the development of an optimal prompt to communicate inclusion and exclusion criteria, the need to describe ecosystem condition as a multidimensional concept whilst also maintaining clarity on what does not meet the criteria of comprehensiveness. We show that, although not completely infallible, the GPT-3.5 model significantly outperforms traditional literature screening processes in terms of speed and efficiency whilst correctly selecting 83 % of relevant literature for review. Our study highlights the importance of precision in prompt design and the setting of query parameters for the AI model and opens the perspective for future work using language models to contextualize complex concepts in the environmental sciences.

    abstract = {Background
Asthma is a prevalent chronic respiratory disease requiring ongoing patient education and individualized management. The increasing reliance on digital tools, particularly generative artificial intelligence (AI), to answer health-related questions has raised concerns about the accuracy, reliability, and comprehensibility of AI-generated information for people living with asthma.
Objective
To evaluate systematically the reliability, accuracy, comprehensiveness, and understandability of responses generated by three widely used artificial intelligence–based chatbots (ChatGPT, Bard, and Copilot) to common questions formulated by people with asthma.
Methods
In this cross-sectional study, 15 questions regarding asthma management were formulated by patients and categorized by difficulty. Responses from ChatGPT, Bard, and Copilot were evaluated by international experts for accuracy and comprehensiveness, and by patient representatives for understandability. Reliability was assessed through consistency testing across devices. We conducted a blinded evaluation.
Results
A total of 21 experts and 16 patient representatives participated in the evaluation. ChatGPT demonstrated the highest reliability (15 of 15 responses), accuracy (median score, 9.0; interquartile range [IQR], 7.0-9.0), and comprehensiveness (median score, 8.0; IQR, 8.0-9.0) compared with Bard and Copilot (P < .0001). Bard achieved superior scores in understandability (median score, 9.0; IQR, 8.0-10.0; P < .0001). Performance differences were consistent across question difficulty levels.
Conclusions
Artificial intelligence–driven chatbots can provide generally accurate and understandable responses to asthma-related questions. Variability in reliability and accuracy underscores the need for caution in clinical contexts. Artificial intelligence tools may complement but cannot replace professional medical advice in asthma management.},

The widespread use of Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (known as ChatGPT) and other emerging technology that is powered by generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has drawn attention to the potential ethical issues they can cause, especially in high-stakes applications such as health care, but ethical discussions have not yet been translated into operationalisable solutions. Furthermore, ongoing ethical discussions often neglect other types of GenAI that have been used to synthesise data (eg, images) for research and practical purposes, which resolve some ethical issues and expose others. We did a scoping review of the ethical discussions on GenAI in health care to comprehensively analyse gaps in the research. To reduce the gaps, we have developed a checklist for comprehensive assessment and evaluation of ethical discussions in GenAI research. The checklist can be integrated into peer review and publication systems to enhance GenAI research and might be useful for ethics-related disclosures for GenAI-powered products and health-care applications of such products and beyond.},

    abstract = {Objectives
Congenital heart diseases (CHD) are a significant cause of neonatal mortality and morbidity. Detecting these abnormalities during pregnancy increases survival rates, enhances prognosis, and improves pregnancy management and quality of life for the affected families. Foetal echocardiography can be considered an accurate method for detecting CHDs. However, the detection of CHDs can be limited by factors such as the sonographer's skill, expertise and patient specific variables. Using artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to address these challenges, increasing antenatal CHD detection during prenatal care. A scoping review was conducted using Google Scholar, PubMed, and ScienceDirect databases, employing keywords, Boolean operators, and inclusion and exclusion criteria to identify peer-reviewed studies. Thematic mapping and synthesis of the found literature were conducted to review key concepts, research methods and findings.
Key findings
A total of n = 233 articles were identified, after exclusion criteria, the focus was narrowed to n = 7 that met the inclusion criteria. Themes in the literature identified the potential of AI to assist clinicians and trainees, alongside emerging new ethical limitations in ultrasound imaging.
Conclusion
AI-based tools in ultrasound imaging offer great potential in assisting sonographers and doctors with decision-making in CHD diagnosis. However, due to the paucity of data and small sample sizes, further research and technological advancements are needed to improve reliability and integrate AI into routine clinical practice.
Implications for practice
This scoping review identified the reported accuracy and limitations of AI-based tools within foetal cardiac ultrasound imaging. AI has the potential to aid in reducing missed diagnoses, enhance training, and improve pregnancy management. There is a need to understand and address the ethical and legal considerations involved with this new paradigm in imaging.},

Moreover, energy operators are also facing a significant undertaking: how to best use and secure large amounts of data that promote sustainable productivity performance and minimise potential threats in the oil and gas value chain and project operations. In view of the foregoing, various facets like Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) and Machine Learning Algorithms (MLA) are increasingly gaining popularity within oil and gas sector operations. Thus, we explored how GAI and ML algorithms can enhance oil and gas value chain productivity performance. The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was employed to identify significant GAI and MLA variables influencing performance in the oil and gas value chain, while Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) was used to test regression equations related to their application. The study found that risk portfolios and profiles can be appraised throughout the value chain by effectively utilising GAI and ML algorithms in upstream, midstream and downstream undertakings. While these findings are noteworthy and have significant implications for current practice, the paper advocates that an array of digital technologies beyond GAI and ML can still be examined during future studies to demonstrate a holistic perspective on how digital transformation can be achieved across the energy sector value and project operations.},

@article{ODRI2023103706,
    abstract = {Background
Artificial intelligence (AI) tools, although beneficial for data collection and analysis, can also facilitate scientific fraud. AI detectors can help resolve this problem, but their effectiveness depends on their ability to track AI progress. In addition, many methods of evading AI detection exist and their constantly evolving sophistication can make the task more difficult. Thus, from an AI-generated text, we wanted to: (1) evaluate the AI detection sites on a text generated entirely by the AI, (2) test the methods described for evading AI detection, and (3) evaluate the effectiveness of these methods to evade AI detection on the sites tested previously.
Hypothesis
Not all AI detection tools are equally effective in detecting AI-generated text and some techniques used to evade AI detection can make an AI-produced text almost undetectable.
Materials and methods
We created a text with ChatGPT-4 (Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer) and submitted it to 11 AI detection web tools (Originality, ZeroGPT, Writer, Copyleaks, Crossplag, GPTZero, Sapling, Content at scale, Corrector, Writefull et Quill), before and after applying strategies to minimise AI detection. The strategies used to minimize AI detection were the improvement of command messages in ChatPGT, the introduction of minor grammatical errors such as comma deletion, paraphrasing, and the substitution of Latin letters with similar Cyrillic letters (а and о) which is also a method used elsewhere to evade the detection of plagiarism. We have also tested the effectiveness of these tools in correctly identifying a scientific text written by a human in 1960.
Results
From the initial text generated by the AI, 7 of the 11 detectors concluded that the text was mainly written by humans. Subsequently, the introduction of simple modifications, such as the removal of commas or paraphrasing can effectively reduce AI detection and make the text appear human for all detectors. In addition, replacing certain Latin letters with Cyrillic letters can make an AI text completely undetectable. Finally, we observe that in a paradoxical way, certain sites detect a significant proportion of AI in a text written by a human in 1960.
Discussion
AI detectors have low efficiency, and simple modifications can allow even the most robust detectors to be easily bypassed. The rapid development of generative AI raises questions about the future of scientific writing but also about the detection of scientific fraud, such as data fabrication.

    abstract = {Background
Tobacco use remains a significant global health challenge, contributing substantially to preventable morbidity and mortality. Despite established interventions, outcomes vary due to scalability issues, resource constraints, and limited reach.
Objective
To systematically explore current artificial intelligence (AI) applications within tobacco control, highlighting their usefulness, benefits, limitations, and ethical implications.
Method
This scoping review followed the Arksey and O’Malley framework and PRISMA-ScR guidelines. Five major databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, and PsycINFO) were searched for articles published between January 2010 and March 2025. From 1,172 initial records, 57 studies met inclusion criteria after screening.
Results
AI-driven tools, including machine learning and natural language processing, effectively monitor social media for emerging tobacco trends and personalize smoking cessation interventions. Applications were predominantly focused on predictive modelling (using algorithms like XGBoost and SVM to predict e-cigarette use and relapse risk), cessation support (employing chatbots and reinforcement learning to improve accessibility), and social media surveillance (detecting synthetic nicotine promotions and analysing vaping trends). Approximately 22% of studies aligned with WHO FCTC Article 13 (tobacco advertising regulation), while 45% supported Article 14 (cessation services). However, tobacco industry interference remains a critical challenge, with AI technologies exploited to undermine public health initiatives, target vulnerable populations, and manipulate policy discussions. Critical issues including algorithmic bias, privacy concerns, interpretability challenges, and data quality must be addressed to ensure positive impact.
Conclusion
AI holds considerable promise for extending tobacco control if implemented ethically, transparently, and collaboratively. Future directions emphasize explainable AI development, integration of real-time intervention systems, global data inclusion, and robust cross-sector collaboration. While the current landscape shows a laudable start, it reflects the need for more diverse skill sets to fully harness AI’s extensive prospects for tobacco control and achieving tobacco endgame goals.},

@article{OMALLEY2024,
    abstract = {Background
In medical education, particularly in anatomy and dermatology, generative artificial intelligence (AI) can be used to create customized illustrations. However, the underrepresentation of darker skin tones in medical textbooks and elsewhere, which serve as training data for AI, poses a significant challenge in ensuring diverse and inclusive educational materials.
Objective
This study aims to evaluate the extent of skin tone diversity in AI-generated medical images and to test whether the representation of skin tones can be improved by modifying AI prompts to better reflect the demographic makeup of the US population.
Methods
In total, 2 standard AI models (Dall-E [OpenAI] and Midjourney [Midjourney Inc]) each generated 100 images of people with psoriasis. In addition, a custom model was developed that incorporated a prompt injection aimed at “forcing” the AI (Dall-E 3) to reflect the skin tone distribution of the US population according to the 2012 American National Election Survey. This custom model generated another set of 100 images. The skin tones in these images were assessed by 3 researchers using the New Immigrant Survey skin tone scale, with the median value representing each image. A chi-square goodness of fit analysis compared the skin tone distributions from each set of images to that of the US population.
Results
The standard AI models (Dalle-3 and Midjourney) demonstrated a significant difference between the expected skin tones of the US population and the observed tones in the generated images (P<.001). Both standard AI models overrepresented lighter skin. Conversely, the custom model with the modified prompt yielded a distribution of skin tones that closely matched the expected demographic representation, showing no significant difference (P=.04).
Conclusions
This study reveals a notable bias in AI-generated medical images, predominantly underrepresenting darker skin tones. This bias can be effectively addressed by modifying AI prompts to incorporate real-life demographic distributions. The findings emphasize the need for conscious efforts in AI development to ensure diverse and representative outputs, particularly in educational and medical contexts. Users of generative AI tools should be aware that these biases exist, and that similar tendencies may also exist in other types of generative AI (eg, large language models) and in other characteristics (eg, sex, gender, culture, and ethnicity). Injecting demographic data into AI prompts may effectively counteract these biases, ensuring a more accurate representation of the general population.},

To assess innovation skills and attitudes toward artificial intelligence
Background
The rapid advancement of modern healthcare technologies necessitates the transformation of traditionally structured nursing education. Attitudes toward innovation and artificial intelligence technologies will be crucial in determining their future impact on patient care. Therefore, assessing these attitudes early will be a significant step in shaping the future of nursing education.
Design
A cross-sectional multicenter study and adhering to STROBE guidelines.
Method
The study was performed at nursing schools of three universities, surveying a total of 269 first-year nursing students enrolled in 2024. A validated instrument, Innovation Skills Measurement Tool for Youth and the General Attitudes towards Artificial Intelligence Scale. Descriptive statistics, Student's t-test and One-Way ANOVA tests were used in the analyses.
Results

    abstract = {Introduction
Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (ChatGPT) is a natural language processing model. It can be argued that ChatGPT has recently begun to assume the role of a technological assistant capable of supporting academics in the process of scientific writing. ChatGPT may contribute to the spread of incorrect or incomplete information within academic literature, leading to conceptual confusion and potential academic misconduct. The aim of this study is to determine whether a scientific article entirely generated by an AI application such as ChatGPT can be detected by an academic journal editor or peer reviewer.
Methods
This study was conducted between November 1, 2024, and December 1, 2024. GPT-4o, was utilized in this study. ChatGPT was instructed to write a scientific article focused on predicting mortality and return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) in OHCA cases. The manuscript written by ChatGPT-4o was sent to 14 different reviewers who had previously served as reviewers or editors. The reviewers were asked to evaluate the manuscript as if they were an SCI-E journal editor or peer reviewer. The reviewers were informed that the article had been written by ChatGPT and were asked whether they had identified this during their review.
Results
Among the reviewers, 42.9 % (n = 6) decided to reject the manuscript at the editorial stage, whereas another 42.9 % (n = 6) opted to forward it to a peer reviewer. During the peer review stage, 42.9 % (n = 6) of the reviewers recommended rejection, while 28.6 % (n = 4) suggested major revisions. 78.6 % (n = 11) of the reviewers did not realize that the manuscript had been generated by an artificial intelligence model.
Conclusion
The findings of our study highlight the necessity for journal editors and peer reviewers to be well-informed about ChatGPT and to develop systems capable of identifying whether a manuscript has been written by a human or generated by artificial intelligence.},

Statement of problem
Despite advances in artificial intelligence (AI), the quality, reliability, and understandability of health-related information provided by chatbots is still a question mark. Furthermore, studies on maxillofacial prosthesis (MP) information from AI chatbots are lacking.
Purpose
The purpose of this study was to assess and compare the reliability, quality, readability, and similarity of responses to MP-related questions generated by 4 different chatbots.
Material and methods
A total of 15 questions were provided by a maxillofacial prosthodontist and from 4 different chatbots (ChatGPT-3.5, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Copilot, and DeepSeek V3). The Reliability Scoring (adapted DISCERN), the Global Quality Scale (GQS), the Flesch Reading Ease Score (FRES), the Flesch-Kincaid Reading Grade Level (FKRGL), and the Similarity Index (iThenticate) were used to evaluate the performance of chatbots. Data were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis test, and the differences between chatbots were determined by the Conover multiple comparison test with Benjamini-Hochberg correction (α=.05).
Results
There were no significant differences between the chatbots' DISCERN scores, except for one question where ChatGPT showed significantly higher reliability than Gemini or Copilot (P=.03). There was no statistically significant difference among AI tools in terms of GQS values (P=.096), FRES values (P=.166), and FKRGL values (P=.247). The similarity rate of Gemini was statistically higher than other AI chatbots (P=.03).
Conclusions
ChatGPT-3.5, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Copilot, and DeepSeek V3 showed good quality responses. All chatbots' responses were difficult for non-professionals to read and understand. Low similarity rates were found for all chatbots except Gemini, indicating originality of their information.},

Textual features were extracted using TF-IDF vectorization which calculates term frequency (TF) and Inverse document frequency (IDF), and combines the two measures to produce a score for individual terms. The Random Forest model was trained and tested using the Scikit-Learn library and Jupyter Notebook service in the Google Colab cloud-based environment, with Google CPU hardware acceleration.
Results
The model achieved a classification accuracy of 81.8 % and an area under the ROC curve of 0.9. For human-generated content, precision, recall, and F1-score were 0.85, 0.78, and 0.81, respectively. For AI-generated content, these metrics were 0.79, 0.86, and 0.82. The MCC value of 0.64 indicated moderate to strong predictive power. The model demonstrated robust sensitivity (recall for AI-generated class) of 0.86 and specificity (recall for human-generated class) of 0.78.
Conclusions
The model exhibited acceptable performance, as measured by classification accuracy, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, and other metrics. This approach can be further improved by incorporating additional supervised machine learning techniques and serves as a foundation for the future development of a sophisticated and innovative AI system. Such a system could play a crucial role in combating misinformation and enhancing public trust across various government platforms, media outlets, and social networks.},

The directed design and discovery of compounds with pre-determined properties is a long-standing challenge in materials research. We provide a perspective on progress toward achieving this goal using generative models for chemical compositions and crystal structures based on a set of powerful statistical techniques drawn from the artificial intelligence community. We introduce the central concepts underpinning generative models of crystalline materials. Coverage is provided of early implementations for inorganic crystals based on generative adversarial networks and variational autoencoders through to ongoing progress involving autoregressive and diffusion models. The influence of the choice of chemical representation and the generative architecture is discussed, along with metrics for quantifying the quality of the hypothetical compounds produced. While further developments are required to enable realistic predictions drawn from richer structure and property datasets, generative artificial intelligence is already proving to be complementary to traditional materials design strategies.},

    abstract = {This study introduces a novel 3D preform design method that leverages generative artificial intelligence to optimise complex forging geometries. The 3D preform shape is simplified by expressing it in a two-dimensional manner based on the geometric features of the forged shape. A beta-variational autoencoder (β-VAE) serves as the generative model, paired with a surrogate model using deep neural networks (DNN) to explore and optimise preform geometries efficiently. The initial training dataset for the generative model is created using isosurfaces derived from Laplace’s equation. A multi-objective optimisation framework is developed to minimise forging load and flash volume and mitigate underfill and lap defects. Preforms were designed using this method and validated through forging experiments on two target geometries: a brake calliper and an electric vehicle (EV) manifold. The forging results of the optimised preforms were compared with traditional isosurface methods, demonstrating that the proposed method reduces forging load and flash volume while preventing underfill and lap defects. This integrated approach combines advanced computational techniques with practical validation, offering a systematic and adaptable solution for the challenges associated with 3D preform design in forging processes.},

This paper introduces Blockchain-Assisted Explainable Decision Traces (BAXDT), a novel architecture designed to enhance the transparency and auditability of AI systems. BAXDT creates comprehensive, immutable records for each AI decision by integrating model outputs, SHAP-based XAI summaries, a novel Explanation Density Metric, and detailed model/data context into a unified JSON trace. The 0.80 threshold for the Explanation Density Metric was empirically supported by Kneedle-based automatic threshold detection. The BAXDT architecture leverages blockchain by recording a cryptographic hash of each decision trace on-chain, while the full trace is stored off-chain. The system's effectiveness was demonstrated through a multi-faceted evaluation: simulations across three diverse public datasets (medical, financial, educational) confirmed its domain-agnostic applicability; a scalability analysis of up to 20,000 traces demonstrated its efficient and linear performance; and a successful deployment on the Ethereum Sepolia public testnet verified its real-world viability. A case study on text data further underscored the framework's flexibility. BAXDT provides a robust framework for documenting AI decisions - what, why, based on what, and when - thereby fostering trustworthy AI and supporting regulatory compliance.},

    abstract = {Background
Those receiving the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) over the next ten years will predominantly be part of Generation Z (Gen Z). Recent observations within our clinic suggest that younger people with MS utilize online generative artificial intelligence (AI) platforms for personalized medical advice prior to their first visit with a specialist in neuroimmunology. The use of such platforms is anticipated to increase given the technology driven nature, desire for instant communication, and cost-conscious nature of Gen Z. Our objective was to determine if ChatGPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) could diagnose MS in individuals earlier than their clinical timeline, and to assess if the accuracy differed based on age, sex, and race/ethnicity.
Methods
People with MS between 18 and 59 years of age were studied. The clinical timeline for people diagnosed with MS was retrospectively identified and simulated using ChatGPT-3.5 (GPT-3.5). Chats were conducted using both actual and derivatives of their age, sex, and race/ethnicity to test diagnostic accuracy. A Kaplan-Meier survival curve was estimated for time to diagnosis, clustered by subject. The p-value testing for differences in time to diagnosis was accomplished using a general Wilcoxon test. Logistic regression (subject-specific intercept) was used to capture intra-subject correlation to test the accuracy prior to and after the inclusion of MRI data.
Results
The study cohort included 100 unique people with MS. Of those, 50 were members of Gen Z (38 female; 22 White; mean age at first symptom was 20.6 years (y) (standard deviation (SD)=2.2y)), and 50 were non-Gen Z (34 female; 27 White; mean age at first symptom was 37.0y (SD=10.4y)). In addition, a total of 529 people that represented digital simulations of the original cohort of 100 people (333 female; 166 White; 136 Black/African American; 107 Asian; 120 Hispanic, mean age at first symptom was 31.6y (SD=12.4y)) were generated allowing for 629 scripted conversations to be analyzed. The estimated median time to diagnosis in clinic was significantly longer at 0.35y (95% CI=[0.28, 0.48]) versus that by ChatGPT at 0.08y (95% CI=[0.04, 0.24]) (p<0.0001). There was no difference in the diagnostic accuracy between ages and by race/ethnicity prior to the inclusion of MRI data. However, prior to including the MRI data, males had a 47% less likely chance of a correct diagnosis relative to females (p=0.05). Post-MRI data inclusion within GPT-3.5, the odds of an accurate diagnosis was 4.0-fold greater for Gen Z participants, relative to non-Gen Z participants (p=0.01) with the diagnostic accuracy being 68% less in males relative to females (p=0.009), and 75% less for White subjects, relative to non-White subjects (p=0.0004).
Conclusion
Although generative AI platforms enable rapid information access and are not principally designed for use in healthcare, an increase in use by Gen Z is anticipated. However, the obtained responses may not be generalizable to all users and bias may exist in select groups.},

Online resources are described to offer fundamental AI knowledge and essential technical skills and to facilitate clinician participation across the entire AI lifecycle, ensuring they contribute not only as end users but also in development and deployment. Unlike traditional statistical approaches that prioritize interpretable parameters and clinical insight, AI focuses on maximizing predictive accuracy by identifying complex, often non-linear patterns using high-dimensional data, albeit often at the cost of model interpretability. AI is demonstrating clinical utility in liver histopathology and radiological imaging, significantly improving detection accuracy for cirrhosis, clinically significant portal hypertension, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Beyond diagnostics, AI-driven prediction models are emerging to provide personalized risk stratification for the development of liver-related complications and treatment guidance, based on complex data including longitudinal laboratory results, comorbidities, and co-medication use to monitor disease progression and therapy response. The field is rapidly expanding into novel areas such as analyzing patient-reported outcomes, genomic data, and real-time liver function monitoring, offering deeper mechanistic insights alongside clinical tools. Despite the potential to revolutionize hepatology practice and research, successful integration into routine care faces challenges. These include seamless workflow integration with existing electronic health records, establishing clear liability frameworks, and guaranteeing protection of patient privacy. Addressing these hurdles requires collaborative efforts from clinicians, researchers, and regulators to develop best practices and governance.

More recently, LLMs have shown unique potential in numerous applications within medicine but have been particularly investigated for their ability in clinical reasoning. Although the diagnostic accuracy of LLMs in forming differential diagnoses has been reviewed in general internal medicine applications, much is unknown in autoinflammatory disorders. From the nature of autoinflammatory diseases, forming a differential diagnosis is challenging due to the overlapping symptoms between disorders and even more difficult without genetic screening. In this work, the diagnostic accuracy of the Generative Pre-Trained Transformer Model-4 (GPT-4), GPT-3.5, and Large Language Model Meta AI (LLaMa) were evaluated in clinical vignettes of Deficiency of Interleukin-1 Receptor Antagonist (DIRA) and Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF). We then compared these models to a control group including one internal medicine physician. It was found that GPT-4 did not significantly differ in correctly identifying DIRA and FMF patients compared to the internist. However, the physician maintained a significantly higher accuracy than GPT-3.5 and LLaMa 2 for either disease. Overall, we explore and discuss the unique potential of LLMs in diagnostics for autoimmune diseases.},

    abstract = {Quantum Computing (QC) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have emerged as key technologies in the evolution of Industry 6.0, driving advancements in automation and advanced analytics, and process optimization. Their integration holds the potential to revolutionize sectors such as data science, healthcare, finance, and cybersecurity by enabling faster and more efficient computations through qubits, superposition, and quantum entanglement. However, the lack of structured knowledge regarding specific QC methodologies and applications in AI hinders its optimal implementation and development. Consequently, this study aims to identify the applications and variables associated with QC-AI integration. To this end, a systematic literature review was conducted following the PRISMA 2020 methodology, drawing on studies from Scopus and Web of Science databases. This enabled the analysis of trends, limitations, and opportunities in this technological convergence. This study aims to systematically examine the intersection of quantum computing and artificial intelligence by identifying the key technological features, integration requirements, and sectoral applications that define the current state of the field. The review contributes by mapping existing research, highlighting methodological approaches, and revealing gaps that may guide targeted advancements in hybrid quantum AI systems. The insights generated have the potential to accelerate innovation in high-impact domains such as healthcare, finance, energy, and cybersecurity. The findings indicate that the main advances in QC applied to AI focus on quantum optimization, Quantum Machine Learning (QML), and post-quantum cryptography. Notably, sectors such as energy, healthcare, and finance have shown significant progress in adopting these technologies. For example, in healthcare, QML has been applied to simulate molecular interactions to accelerate drug discovery, and in finance, it enhances predictive models for market behavior. The study concludes that although QC demonstrates substantial potential to enhance AI, its broader adoption remains constrained by reliance on NISQ hardware, the need for effective error correction, and the limited scalability of hybrid quantum classical algorithms. Addressing these challenges will be essential to establishing QML as a cornerstone of technological innovation and digital transformation. Additionally, this review introduces an integrative framework that categorizes key AI QC convergence dimensions and proposes a classification of application areas based on technical requirements and algorithmic capabilities. These contributions aim to guide future experimental validations and hybrid model development.},

    abstract = {ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND
The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine has increased dramatically. Its utilization will expand in cardiothoracic (CT) surgery, altering current practice. We surveyed CT surgeons to gain insight into their beliefs, hopes, and fears regarding AI.
METHODS
A 25-question instrument addressing AI use in CT surgery was created, focusing on the domains of role, value, effect, threat, and regulation of AI. In coordination with several cardiothoracic surgical societies, the survey was electronically distributed to and completed by the societies’ members. After filtering, 424 complete de-identified responses were collected and analyzed. Answers were scored on a Likert scale and collapsed into categories for analysis.
RESULTS
There was a broad range of responses that varied from very negative to very positive. Most statistically significant differences in responses among demographics primarily related to the role and value of AI in clinical care areas. Specifically, female surgeons, younger surgeons, and thoracic (as opposed to cardiac) surgeons envisioned a smaller role for AI. Physicians felt that regulation of AI should come from professional societies and federal governments, and supported a proactive approach to the integration of AI into CT surgery, including engagement with industry and sharing of specialty specific texts and databases.
CONCLUSIONS
As AI is further implemented in medicine, CT surgery faces a rapidly changing landscape. Expectedly, feelings among physicians are mixed. However, there are clear areas of agreement as to the benefit of AI integration and broad support for proactive approaches to integration.},

    abstract = {Background
The US healthcare system is currently facing significant challenges in quality, affordability, and labor shortages. Artificial intelligence (AI) promises to transform healthcare delivery by making it safer, more effective, less wasteful, and more patient-centered. With more than $30 billion invested in healthcare AI companies in the past three years, the proliferation of AI solutions is expected to bring much-needed relief to the strained healthcare industry. To harness the current enthusiasm for AI in healthcare, we can draw parallels to the adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) under the HITECH Act of 2009. EHR adoption has been widespread and has contributed to significant health information technology spending, but it has also brought unintended consequences, such as clinician burnout, workarounds, and mixed impacts on patient safety and quality measures.
The EHR Era vs. the AI Era: Differences
This article grounds the discussion by first reviewing the key differences between the EHR implementation era that followed the passage of HITECH and the current AI era. The authors identified three characteristics of the AI era that distinguish it from the EHR implementation era: different regulatory and legislative context, diminished capacity of the workforce to absorb new work, and an accelerated pace of change.
Lessons from EHR Implementation to Carry Forward to AI Implementation
Based on the collective experience of the authorship team and published literature on EHR and AI implementation, the authors identified five critical lessons from the EHR implementation era that organizations deploying AI must consider: (1) respect the human element, (2) build strong organizational governance, (3) adapt leadership and culture, (4) ready the workforce, and (5) build for the long term.
Conclusion
By applying these lessons, organizational leaders can realize the potential of AI to improve patient outcomes and transform healthcare delivery.},

To summarize the relevance of remote symptom monitoring, person-centered statistical analyses, and artificial intelligence to precision health symptom science in oncology; and propose ways in which these three approaches can be integrated to further advance the field.
Methods
The following commentary was adapted from a talk delivered at the Symptom Science Experts Meeting in October 2023 at the University of Lausanne, Switzerland. The commentary and talk were informed by an informal review of recent literature in precision health oncology symptom science.
Results
Several remote symptom monitoring interventions have demonstrated potential to reduce disease- and treatment-related symptom burden and improve health outcomes in patients with cancer. Data collected passively by wearable and sensor technologies are also being used to characterize patients’ health status. Person-centered statistical analyses have identified interindividual variability in the symptom experiences of patients with cancer. Together with artificial intelligence-based approaches, these analyses have identified factors associated with relatively adverse symptom experiences. Future directions for the field include integrating these approaches to optimize clinical resource allocation, tailor symptom management in real-time, and advance scientific knowledge of the symptom experience.
Conclusions
Integrating remote symptom monitoring, person-centered statistical analyses and artificial intelligence may provide deeper insights into how patients with cancer experience symptoms.

Objective
This study aimed to synthesize the potential opportunities and limitations of generative AI in medical education. It sought to identify prevalent themes within recent literature regarding potential applications and challenges of generative AI in medical education and use these to guide future areas for exploration.
Methods
We conducted a scoping review, following the framework by Arksey and O'Malley, of English language articles published from 2022 onward that discussed generative AI in the context of medical education. A literature search was performed using PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases. We screened articles for inclusion, extracted data from relevant studies, and completed a quantitative and qualitative synthesis of the data.
Results
Thematic analysis revealed diverse potential applications for generative AI in medical education, including self-directed learning, simulation scenarios, and writing assistance. However, the literature also highlighted significant challenges, such as issues with academic integrity, data accuracy, and potential detriments to learning. Based on these themes and the current state of the literature, we propose the following 3 key areas for investigation: developing learners’ skills to evaluate AI critically, rethinking assessment methodology, and studying human-AI interactions.
Conclusions
The integration of generative AI in medical education presents exciting opportunities, alongside considerable challenges. There is a need to develop new skills and competencies related to AI as well as thoughtful, nuanced approaches to examine the growing use of generative AI in medical education.},

Recently, there has been a surge in the development of this technology. However, existing deep learning-based design methods for shear wall structures suffer from poor quality and usability issues. To address these challenges, this study proposes an intelligent design and optimization system for shear wall structures based on large language models (LLMs) and generative artificial intelligence (AI). The system employs an LLM as the core controller, which interacts with engineers to interpret their language descriptions and translate them into executable computer code. Subsequently, the system utilizes the corresponding structural generation and optimization methods to accomplish intelligent design tasks automatically. Furthermore, the system incorporates such critical factors as the empirical rules, mechanical performance, and material consumption into the structural optimization process. A unique three-level, two-stage optimization method is constructed based on topology, pattern, and size to enhance the overall design quality. Being able to complete the entire workflow of architectural drawing processing, structural scheme generation, and analysis model establishment, the proposed system enables automated and efficient design of shear wall structures. Through the analysis and validation of multiple cases, it was demonstrated that this system can significantly speed up the design by approximately 30 times compared to that of traditional methods whilst ensuring the safety and cost-effectiveness of the design schemes. Consequently, this study provides valuable insights for the advancement of automated structural design undertakings.},

However, the growing popularity and influence of models such as ChatGPT have raised concerns in education regarding academic integrity, as AI-generated content challenges the authenticity of student work and complicates traditional assessment practices. Existing plagiarism detection tools, such as Turnitin and GPTZero, attempt to identify AI-generated content; however, their reliability remains limited, as most struggle to accurately differentiate between human and AI essays. To address existing tools limitations, we propose a novel detection model leveraging three large language models (LLMs): Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2 (GPT-2), Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach (RoBERTa), and Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers (BART). We first fine-tuned each model on two large-scale datasets to evaluate their effectiveness in distinguishing between human and AI-generated essays. To further enhance the performance, we applied both manual and automated hyperparameter optimization techniques, including Random Search, Grid Search, and Bayesian Optimization. Building on these experiments, we developed our BART-CNN model, which incorporates the best-performing BART configuration with an additional convolutional head classifier. Our BART-CNN model achieved impressive Macro F1-scores of 99.78 % and 98.10 % on the Kaggle and Hugging Face datasets, respectively, and demonstrated significant performance gains over baseline methods in cross-domain validation.

    abstract = {Objectives
This study mapped the editorial policies regarding the use and acknowledgment of artificial intelligence (AI) in dental journals.
Methods
Dental journals indexed in Web of Science were analyzed. Editorial guidelines and instructions for authors and reviewers were assessed. The outcome of interest was whether a journal reported an AI policy. Exposures of interest were Journal Impact Factor (JIF), Journal Citation Indicator (JCI), total number of citations, and percentage of open access content. Associations between journal metrics and the presence of AI policies were assessed using Poisson regression models with robust standard errors. Adjusted models were developed separately for JIF and JCI, including variables with p ≤ 0.2. Significance was set at p ≤ 0.05.
Results
Among the 158 journals analyzed, 70.9 % reported AI policies. Policies targeted authors (100 %), reviewers (88.4 %), and editors (46.4 %). The most common areas addressed were authorship, language review, and writing assistance. Journals in the upper quartiles of JIF and JCI were about twice as likely to report an AI policy compared to those in the lowest quartile. In the adjusted models, no association was found between total citations and AI policy presence, whereas open access percentage showed a negative association. While AI tools are permitted to aid in language refinement, critical tasks were consistently required to remain human-led, with rare exceptions.
Conclusion
AI-related editorial policies were frequent in dental journals, and higher-impact journals were statistically more likely to report such policies.

In particular, Gen-AI text-to-image models allow people to easily create high-quality images possibly revolutionizing human creative practices. Despite their increasing use, however, the broader population's perceptions and understandings of Gen-AI-generated images remain understudied in the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) community. This study investigates how individuals, including those unfamiliar with Gen-AI, perceive Gen-AI text-to-image (Stable Diffusion) outputs. Study findings reveal that participants appraise Gen-AI images based on their technical quality and fidelity in representing a subject, often experiencing them as either prototypical or strange: these experiences may raise awareness of societal biases and evoke unsettling feelings that extend to the Gen-AI itself. The study also uncovers several “relational” strategies that participants employ to cope with concerns related to Gen-AI, contributing to the understanding of reactions to uncanny technology and the (de)humanization of intelligent agents. Moreover, the study offers design suggestions on how to use the anthropomorphizing of the text-to-image model as design material, and the Gen-AI images as support for critical design sessions.},

    abstract = {Objectives
Artificial intelligence (AI) is widely used in healthcare for various purposes, with generative AI (GAI) increasingly being applied to systematic review (SR) processes. We aimed to summarize the evidence on the performance metrics of GAI in the SR process.
Methods
PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global were searched from their inception up to March 2025. Only experimental studies that compared GAI with other GAIs or human reviewers at any stage of the SR were included. Modified Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies version 2 was used to assess the quality of the studies that used GAI in the study selection process. We summarized the findings of the included studies using a narrative approach.
Results
Out of 7418 records screened, 30 studies were included. These studies used GAI tools such as ChatGPT, Bard, and Microsoft Bing AI. GAI appears to be effective for participant, intervention, comparator, and outcome formulation and data extraction processes, including complex information. However, because of inconsistent reliability, GAI is not recommended for literature search and study selection as it may retrieve nonrelevant articles and yield inconsistent results. There was mixed evidence on whether GAI can be used for risk of bias assessment. Studies using GAI for study selection were generally of high quality based on the modified Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies version 2.
Conclusions
GAI shows promising support in participant, intervention, comparator, and outcome-based question formulation and data extraction. Although it holds potential to enhance the SR process in healthcare, further practical application and validated evidence are needed before it can be fully integrated into standard workflows.},

    abstract = {The rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in medicine has prompted medical professionals to increasingly familiarize themselves with related topics. This also demands grasping the underlying statistical principles that govern their design, validation, and reproducibility. Uniquely, the practice of pathology and medicine produces vast amount of data that can be exploited by AI/ML. The emergence of generative AI, especially in the area of large language models and multimodal frameworks, represents approaches that are starting to transform medicine. Fundamentally, generative and traditional (eg, nongenerative predictive analytics) ML techniques rely on certain common statistical measures to function. However, unique to generative AI are metrics such as, but not limited to, perplexity and BiLingual Evaluation Understudy score that provide a means to determine the quality of generated samples that are typically unfamiliar to most medical practitioners. In contrast, nongenerative predictive analytics ML often uses more familiar metrics tailored to specific tasks as seen in the typical classification (ie, confusion metrics measures, such as accuracy, sensitivity, F1 score, and receiver operating characteristic area under the curve) or regression studies (ie, root mean square error and R2). To this end, the goal of this review article (as part 4 of our AI review series) is to provide an overview and a comparative measure of statistical measures and methodologies used in both generative AI and traditional (ie, nongenerative predictive analytics) ML fields along with their strengths and known limitations. By understanding their similarities and differences along with their respective applications, we will become better stewards of this transformative space, which ultimately enables us to better address our current and future needs and challenges in a more responsible and scientifically sound manner.},

    abstract = {Objectives
In health economics and outcomes research (HEOR), many repetitive tasks could be performed by large language models (LLMs), including adapting Excel-based health economic models and associated Word technical reports to a new setting. However, it is vital to develop robust methods so that the LLM delivers at least human-level accuracy.
Methods
We developed LLM-based pipelines to automate parameter value adaptations for Excel-based models and subsequent reporting of the model results. Chain-of-thought prompting, ensemble shuffling, and task decomposition were used to enhance the accuracy of the LLM-generated content. We tested the pipelines by adapting 3 Excel-based models (2 cost-effectiveness models [CEMs] and 1 budget impact model [BIM]) and their associated technical reports. The quality of reporting was evaluated by 2 expert health economists.
Results
The accuracy of parameter value adaptations was 100% (147 of 147), 100% (207 of 207), and 98.7% (158 of 160) for the 2 CEMs and 1 budget impact model, respectively. The parameter value adaptations were performed without human intervention in 195 seconds, 245 seconds, and 189 seconds. For parameter value adaptations, the application programming interface costs associated with running the pipeline were $13.36, $6.48, and $2.65. The accuracy of report adaptations was 94.4% (17 of 18), 100% (54 of 54), and 95.1% (39 of 41), respectively. The report adaptations were performed in 128 seconds, 336 seconds, and 286 seconds. For report adaptations, the application programming interface costs associated with running the pipeline were $1.53, $4.24, and $4.05.
Conclusions
LLM-based toolchains have the potential to accurately and rapidly perform routine adaptations of Excel-based CEMs and technical reports at a low cost. This could expedite health technology assessments and improve patient access to new treatments.},

The evaluated models are support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), ANN, convolutional neural network (CNN), and transfer learning (TL). To increase the number of available images for training, a generative adversarial network (GAN) was used. Three different databases were used to train models to determine achieved the best performance in terms of model accuracy. The databases used are the original database, an augmentation version of the original database incorporating images generated by the GAN model, and only images generated by the GAN model. The results show that the best model (ANN) achieves a validation accuracy of 99.74% when using an augmentation of the original database with artificial images generated by the GAN model.},

    abstract = {Background
As artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming healthcare, there is a critical need to understand how AI can be thoughtfully integrated into nursing practice to support clinicians, reduce burden, and enhance patient care.
Purpose
We aimed to understand nursing informatics leaders’ perspectives on AI's current and future state in nursing.
Methods
We conducted a qualitative study with 20 national experts in nursing informatics. The Non-Adoption, Abandonment, Scale-up, Spread, Sustainability (NASSS) framework guided data collection and analysis using directed content analysis.
Findings
Participants highlighted the unclear value of AI to nurses and of nurses to technology vendors and AI developers. They identified nursing-specific (burnout, education, and attitudes) and organization-specific (leadership and culture) factors that influence AI’s integration in nursing. They highlighted how education, establishing ideal nurse–AI partnerships, and leveraging AI, may alleviate burnout.
Discussion
Education, empowerment, and elevating nursing voices (“three e’s”) can guide the nursing profession to thrive in the era of AI.},

    abstract = {Objectives
This exploratory study aimed to develop a large language model (LLM)-based process to automate components of network meta-analysis (NMA), including model selection, analysis, output evaluation, and results interpretation. Automating these tasks with LLMs can enhance efficiency, consistency, and scalability in health economics and outcomes research, while ensuring that analyses adhere to established guidelines required by health technology assessment agencies. Improvements in efficiency and scalability may potentially become relevant as the European Union Health Technology Assessment Regulation comes into force, given anticipated analysis requirements and timelines.
Methods
Using Claude 3.5 Sonnet (V2), a process was designed to automate statistical model selection, NMA output evaluation, and results interpretation based on an “analysis-ready” data set. Validation was assessed by replicating examples from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence Technical Support Document (TSD2), replicating results of non-Decision Support Unit-published NMAs, and generating comprehensive outputs (eg, heterogeneity, inconsistency, and convergence).
Results
The automated LLM-based process produced accurate results. Compared with TSD2 examples, differences were minimal, within expectations (given differences in sampling frameworks used), and comparable to those observed between estimates produced by the R vignettes against TSD2. Similar consistency was noted for non-Decision Support Unit-published NMA examples. Additionally, the LLM process generated and interpreted comprehensive NMA outputs.
Conclusions
This exploratory study demonstrates the feasibility of LLMs to automate key components of NMAs, determining the requisite NMA framework based only on input data. Further exploring these capabilities could clarify their role in streamlining NMA workflows.},

    abstract = {The integration of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) into human social contexts has raised fundamental questions about machines' capacity to understand and respond to complex emotional and social dynamics. While recent studies have demonstrated GAI's promising capabilities in processing static emotional content, the frontier of dynamic social cognition – where multiple modalities converge to create naturalistic social scenarios – remained largely unexplored. This study advances our understanding by examining the social-cognitive capabilities of Google's Gemini 1.5 Pro model through its performance on the Movie for the Assessment of Social Cognition (MASC), a sophisticated instrument designed to evaluate mentalization abilities using dynamic audiovisual stimuli. We compared the model's performance to a human normative sample (N = 1230) across varying temperature settings (a parameter controlling the level of randomness in the AI's output, where lower values lead to more deterministic responses and higher values increase variability; set at 0, 0.5, and 1). Results revealed that Gemini 1.5 Pro consistently performed above chance across all conditions (all corrected ps < 0.001, Cohen's h range = 1.17–1.41) and significantly outperformed the human sample mean (Z = 2.24, p = .025; Glass's Δ = 0.92, 95 % CI [0.11, 1.72]; Hedges' g = 0.92, 95 % CI [0.12, 1.72]). Analysis of error patterns revealed a distribution between hyper-mentalizing (41.0 %; over-attribution of mental states), hypo-mentalizing (46.2 %; under-attribution of mental states), and non-mentalizing (12.8 %; failure to recognize mental states) errors. These findings extend our understanding of artificial social cognition to complex multimodal processing while raising important questions about the nature of machine-based social understanding. The implications span theoretical considerations in artificial Theory of Mind to practical applications in mental health care and social skills training, though careful consideration is warranted regarding the fundamental differences between human and artificial social cognitive processing.},

Utilizing generative artificial intelligence, we have developed a framework to swiftly evaluate the γ' solvus temperature and tailor Ni-based superalloys, accelerating the process of discovering Ni-based superalloys. Physics-informed artificial neural network emerged as the optimal choice for reverse engineering, outperforming other models with an R2 score of 0.917 and a mean absolute error of 15 K. In the reverse design process, 20,000 virtual alloy samples were generated based on divide-and-conquer variational autoencoder which divides the dataset into distinct clusters by K-means algorithm provides a structured representation of the alloy composition space, thereby facilitating a more nuanced understanding of its inherent complexities. In a specific alloy design example, 563 samples were identified through screening based on criteria like γ' solvus temperature, composition deviation index, price, and density. Thermodynamic calculations were used to further screen Ni-based superalloys with exceptional high-temperature properties. The showcase of BA alloy discovery through generative artificial intelligence demonstrates the potential of our research to steer the creation of novel compositions for Ni-based superalloys with outstanding high-temperature properties.},

This study addresses these challenges by using generative artificial intelligence (AI) to predict fire scenes in realistic multi-room building layouts, characterized by complex shapes and intricate wall partitions. Three generative AI models for image generation are employed for this purpose: GAN-based pix2pix and pix2pixHD, as well as the diffusion model. These models were trained on an extensive dataset of CFD fire simulations to generate near-ceiling smoke movement and temperature distribution outcomes. When tested on new unseen building layouts, these models demonstrated remarkable accuracy and provided near real-time assessments. The diffusion model achieved the highest accuracy (>94 %) while requiring the more computational time. The high performance of these models highlights the potential of using generative AI to enhance fire safety engineering by enabling faster and more comprehensive fire risk assessments.},

The exponential growth of data from diverse omics modalities, electronic health records, and medical imaging has created unprecedented opportunities for precision medicine. This explosion of data requires advanced processing and analytical tools. At the forefront of this revolution is artificial intelligence (AI), which excels at uncovering hidden patterns within these high-dimensional and complex datasets. AI facilitates the integration and analysis of diverse data types, unlocking unparalleled potential to characterise complex diseases, improve prognosis, and predict treatment response. Despite the enormous potential of AI, challenges related to interpretability, reliability, generalisability, and ethical considerations emerge when translating these tools from research settings into clinical practice.},

    abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence foundation models (for example Generative Pre-trained Transformer – GPT – models) can generate the next token given a sequence of tokens. How can this ‘generative AI’ be compared with the ‘real’ intelligence of the human brain, when for example a human generates a whole memory in response to an incomplete retrieval cue, and then generates further prospective thoughts? Here these two types of generative intelligence, artificial in machines and real in the human brain are compared, and it is shown how when whole memories are generated by hippocampal recall in response to an incomplete retrieval cue, what the human brain computes, and how it computes it, are very different from generative AI. Key differences are the use of local associative learning rules in the hippocampal memory system, and of non-local backpropagation of error learning in AI. Indeed, it is argued that the whole operation of the human brain is performed computationally very differently to what is implemented in generative AI. Moreover, it is emphasized that the primate including human hippocampal system includes computations about spatial view and where objects and people are in scenes, whereas in rodents the emphasis is on place cells and path integration by movements between places. This comparison with generative memory and processing in the human brain has interesting implications for the further development of generative AI and for neuroscience research.},

Through systematic searching of academic databases and grey literature between 2020 and 2024, this scoping literature review examined the emerging landscape of GenAI applications in supporting neurodivergent students (e.g., those with ADHD, autism, dyslexia, gifted, twice-exceptional) within K-12 educational contexts. Twenty-one relevant sources were identified, discussing GenAI usage with neurodivergent students, the analysis revealed discussion of several predominant applications, including personalized learning, administrative assistance for educators, and development of individualized education plans. The review identified both promising approaches and significant concerns. Benefits included GenAI's potential to provide real-time, personalized support for students as well as reducing administrative burdens for educators. However, notable concerns emerged regarding information accuracy, over-reliance on AI, privacy considerations, and the need for human oversight. The limited empirical evidence base was particularly striking, with only nine studies providing original research data. The review identified critical gaps in current understanding, particularly regarding GenAI's effectiveness across different neurodivergent conditions and curriculum areas, and little evidence of approaches detailed in ways that educators could use. This scoping review demonstrates the need for robust empirical research examining GenAI usage in learning for neurodivergent students. These insights are timely and crucial for educators, researchers, and policymakers working to harness GenAI's potential in supporting neurodivergent learners within inclusive educational environments.},

    abstract = {Background
A personal statement is a common requirement in medical residency and fellowship applications. Generative artificial intelligence may be used to create a personal statement for these applications.
Methods
Two personal statements were created using OpenAI’s Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) and two applicant-written statements were collected. A survey was sent to obstetric anesthesia fellowship program directors in the United States to assess the perceived readability, authenticity, and originality of the four personal statements. In addition, the survey assessed perceptions of applicants who use artificial intelligence to write a personal statement, including their integrity, work ethic, reliability, intelligence, and English proficiency.
Results
Surveyed fellowship directors could not accurately discern whether statements were applicant-written or artificial intelligence-generated. The artificial intelligence-generated personal statements were rated as more readable and original than the applicant-written statements. Most program directors were moderately or extremely concerned about the applicant’s integrity, work ethic, and reliability if they suspected the applicant utilized ChatGPT.
Conclusions
Program directors could not accurately discern if the statements were written by a person or artificial intelligence and would have concerns about an applicant suspected of using artificial intelligence. Medical training programs may benefit from outlining their expectations regarding applicants’ use of artificial intelligence.},

Nursing school faculty and staff at one private, southeastern university (n = 364) piloted an internally constrained chatbot system for 2 months in 2024. Data were captured to evaluate the (a) costs of implementation, (b) use cases in nursing education, and (c) projected system impact. Costs were lower than $2 per month, per user. There were 148 diverse case reports from 35 unique users. On a separate survey, 35 respondents rated technology acceptability as 5.2/7.0. Projected impact is high (6.3/7.0), but not entirely positive (5.9/7.0). Benefits and challenges were identified. Nursing will need to invest expert time and community resources to evolve education systems along with these evolving technologies.},

    abstract = {Introduction
Children's voice and communication abilities evolve with age, necessitating tailored protocols for accurate analysis. Distinct vocal properties and communication styles across developmental stages require specific tasks. The absence of standardized pediatric protocols impedes reliable voice data collection, limits robust acoustic measurements, and hinders AI-driven voice research. This study aims to develop age-specific voice data collection protocols, creating a pediatric voice database to advance research and enhance AI applications.
Methods
Protocols were developed iteratively over six months through a multidisciplinary, multi-institutional team involving speech-language pathologists and otolaryngologists. A comprehensive literature review was completed. Emphasis was placed on designing protocols capable of generating high-quality, consistent data for AI modeling while minimizing measurement variability.
Results
Four developmentally appropriate protocols were created for children aged 2 to <4 years, 4 to <6 years, 6 to <10 years, and 10+ years respectively. Each protocol targeted key acoustic parameters while aligning with the linguistic and cognitive abilities of the respective age group. The iterative design incorporated tasks that engaged children while ensuring clinically robust data collection. Standardized protocols were deployed via a user-friendly iPad application, using child-sized headset microphones at fixed distances from the mouth. The protocols were administered to 100 pediatric patients in an otolaryngology clinic between the ages of 2–18.
Conclusions
The development of age specific protocols aims to standardize the collection of pediatric voice and acoustic sound data, which will serve as a valuable resource for advancing artificial intelligence applications within clinical sciences. Future validation will ensure feasibility, adherence, and reliability of data collection to support AI-driven innovations.},

    abstract = {Machine learning models are the backbone of smart grid optimization, but their effectiveness hinges on access to vast amounts of training data. However, smart grids face critical communication bottlenecks due to the ever-increasing volume of data from distributed sensors. This paper introduces a novel approach leveraging Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), specifically a type of pre-trained Foundation Model (FM) architecture suitable for time series data due to its efficiency and privacy-preserving properties. These GenAI models are distributed to agents, or data holders, empowering them to fine-tune the foundation model with their local datasets. By fine-tuning the foundation model, the updated model can produce synthetic data that mirrors real-world grid conditions. The server aggregates fine-tuned model from all agents and then generates synthetic data which considers all data collected in the grid. This synthetic data can be used to train global machine learning models for specific tasks like anomaly detection and energy optimization. Then, the trained task models are distributed to agents in the grid to leverage them. The paper highlights the advantages of GenAI for smart grid communication, including reduced communication burden, enhanced privacy through anonymized data transmission, and improved efficiency and scalability. By enabling a distributed and intelligent communication architecture, GenAI introduces a novel way for a more secure, efficient, and sustainable energy future.},

Inhibiting phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) has emerged as a promising strategy for AD treatment. In this study, we employed a synergistic approach combining generative recurrent neural network (RNN)-driven combinatorial compound design, virtual screening, and structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis to discover novel PDE4 inhibitors. Utilizing α-mangostin as a hit compound (half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) = 1.31 μmol/L), we identified a novel PDE4 inhibitor, 13d (IC50 = 72.8 nmol/L) with moderate liver microsomal stability (rat liver microsomes (RLM), t1/2 = 32.4 min). In vitro activity results indicated that 13d exhibited favorable anti-inflammatory effects and promising neuroprotective activity. In vivo experiments demonstrated that 13d significantly improved AlCl3-induced zebrafish AD model by inhibiting PDE4 and reducing inflammatory cytokine. Further, 13d significantly alleviated AlCl3/D-galactose-induced AD mouse model. These findings highlight the potent PDE4 inhibitor 13d with promising anti-AD activity, underscoring the potential of artificial intelligence-driven drug discovery for novel therapeutic agents for AD.},

    abstract = {The role of artificial intelligence (AI) in cancer drug discovery and development has garnered significant attention due to its potential to transform the traditionally time-consuming and expensive processes involved in bringing new therapies to market. AI technologies, such as machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), enable the efficient analysis of vast datasets, facilitate faster identification of drug targets, optimization of compounds, and prediction of clinical outcomes. This review explores the multifaceted applications of AI across various stages of cancer drug development, from early-stage discovery to clinical trial design, development. In early-stage discovery, AI-driven methods support target identification, virtual screening (VS), and molecular docking, offering precise predictions that streamline the identification of promising compounds. Additionally, AI is instrumental in de novo drug design and lead optimization, where algorithms can generate novel molecular structures and optimize their properties to enhance drug efficacy and safety profiles. Preclinical development benefits from AI's predictive modeling capabilities, particularly in assessing a drug's toxicity through in silico simulations. AI also plays a pivotal role in biomarker discovery, enabling the identification of specific molecular signatures that can inform patient stratification and personalized treatment approaches. In clinical development, AI optimizes trial design by leveraging real-world data (RWD), improving patient selection, and reducing the time required to bring new drugs to market. Despite its transformative potential, challenges remain, including issues related to data quality, model interpretability, and regulatory hurdles. Addressing these limitations is critical for fully realizing AI's potential in cancer drug discovery and development. As AI continues to evolve, its integration with other technologies, such as genomics and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR), holds promise for advancing personalized cancer therapies. This review provides a comprehensive overview of AI's impact on the cancer drug discovery and development and highlights future directions for this rapidly evolving field.},

However, regulatory, ethical, and technical challenges must be addressed to ensure its safe and effective implementation. Bias in AI can lead to disparities in healthcare delivery, while the “black-box problem” raises concerns about transparency and trust. Ethical principles must guide AI integration, particularly regarding patient safety, accountability, and liability. Privacy risks related to data collection and security are especially critical in ophthalmology, where large imaging datasets are essential. Additionally, AI-generated inaccuracies, or “hallucinations,” pose potential risks to clinical decision-making. Cybersecurity threats targeting AI-powered healthcare systems further emphasize the need for robust protections.

    abstract = {Control structure design is an important but tedious step in P&ID development. Generative artificial intelligence (AI) promises to reduce P&ID development time by supporting engineers. Previous research on generative AI in chemical process design mainly represented processes by sequences. However, graphs offer a promising alternative because of their permutation invariance. We propose the Graph-to-SFILES model, a generative AI method to predict control structures from flowsheet topologies. The Graph-to-SFILES model takes the flowsheet topology as a graph input and returns a control-extended flowsheet as a sequence in the SFILES 2.0 notation. We compare four different graph encoder architectures, one of them being a graph neural network (GNN) proposed in this work. The Graph-to-SFILES model achieves a top-5 accuracy of 73.2% when trained on 10,000 flowsheet topologies. In addition, the proposed GNN performs best among the encoder architectures. Compared to a purely sequence-based approach, the Graph-to-SFILES model improves the top-5 accuracy for a relatively small training dataset of 1,000 flowsheets from 0.9% to 28.4%. However, the sequence-based approach performs better on a large-scale dataset of 100,000 flowsheets. These results highlight the potential of graph-based AI models to accelerate P&ID development in small-data regimes but their effectiveness on industry relevant case studies still needs to be investigated.},

    abstract = {Aim
This study investigates the impact of generative artificial intelligence literacy (GAIL) on self-directed learning skills (SDL) among nursing and midwifery students. Additionally, it examines whether general attitudes toward artificial intelligence (GAAI) mediate this relationship.
Background
Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to support the development of clinical decision-making and problem-solving skills in nursing and midwifery education, particularly by enhancing students’ self-directed learning abilities.
Methods
A cross-sectional, descriptive and correlational study design was used. The study was conducted in three universities in Türkiye between January and February 2025. 656 nursing and midwifery students participated, selected through cluster sampling. Data were collected using the GAIL, GAAI and SDL scales. The survey form included descriptive questions regarding participants' socio-demographic characteristics and AI usage patterns. Structural equation modeling was conducted to analyze direct and indirect relationships among variables.
Results
A significant positive effect of GAILS on GAAIS was found (β = 0.75, p < .01). GAILS also had a direct and significant effect on SDLS (β = 0.60, p < .01). However, GAAIS did not mediate the relationship between GAILS and SDLS (β = 0.02, p > .05).
Conclusions
AI literacy significantly enhances SDL in nursing and midwifery students. However, positive attitudes toward AI do not independently foster SDL, highlighting the need for structured AI education in healthcare curricula. Future studies should explore long-term AI literacy interventions to assess their impact on academic outcomes and their potential contributions to clinical reasoning and decision-making skills.},

    abstract = {Timely fault detection in photovoltaic systems is critical for ensuring energy efficiency, reliability, and cost-effectiveness. However, the nonlinear and weather-dependent behavior of photovoltaic systems poses challenges for accurate diagnosis. This study presents a large-scale review of 983 scientific publications on artificial intelligence-based photovoltaic fault detection, using a novel methodology called Topic-tSNE Fusion. This approach integrates topic modeling, dimensionality reduction, and expert analysis to extract and visualize dominant research themes. Four key machine learning paradigms are identified: supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and reinforcement learning. Among them, supervised methods, particularly neural networks and support vector machines, are the most frequently applied, showing accuracies above 95% in controlled conditions. The analysis also reveals growing use of semi-supervised and hybrid approaches to overcome data scarcity. Commonly monitored variables include irradiance, voltage, and current, while the most studied faults are shading, open-circuit, and degradation. Several open-access datasets supporting fault diagnosis research are catalogued. Overall, the proposed method enables a more objective and scalable review process and uncovers emerging trends, such as the shift toward lightweight artificial intelligence for edge deployment and frugal diagnostic architectures. The methodology is scalable and adaptable to other domains facing similar challenges in knowledge synthesis and system monitoring.},

    abstract = {The cyber ecosystem presents two interesting properties. Attackers and defenders are normally the same entity; a detailed knowledge of defensive strategies optimises an attack whereas a good defence, based on a layered structure also includes attacks. In addition, Artificial Intelligence (AI) provides new techniques and tools to both attackers and defenders such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) based on Generators and Discriminators for impersonation or Deep Learning (DL) for exhaustive scanning. To address this dilemma, this article presents CyberAIBot: Artificial Intelligence in an Intrusion Detection System for CyberSecurity in the Internet of Things (IoT) aimed at Operational Technology (OT) and Information Technology (IT) network traffic. CyberAIBot is based on a Deep Learning management structure in a private or local edge cloud computing approach where AI makes decisions as close as possible to the source of data. CyberAIBot gradually detects, learns, and adapts to different cyber attacks. In detail, CyberAIBot uses Deep Learning (DL) technical clusters trained in specific attacks and a Deep Learning (DL) management cluster specialises in taking management decisions rather than technical evaluations. This management cluster supervises conflicting classifications from the deep learning technical clusters. CyberAIbot is trained against several datasets and its performance is evaluated between two classification algorithms, the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). The SVM DL clusters learn faster (average 15x) although the LSTM DL clusters perform better (average 30%). The LSTM DL management cluster performs better than the SVM DL management cluster although it recognises fewer traffic types. The total number of data points analysed by CyberAIBot is 5.52E+08, equivalent to the distance between the planet Earth to the Moon in meters.},

Advertising agencies are not immune to this reality and have also experienced the effects of AI through the advent and widespread use of technologies that enable the design, creation, editing, and writing of content for the advertising industry. This article allows us to measure the impact of the arrival of AI in several advertising agencies, independent and holding companies (such as McCann and Havas Media) in Rio de Janeiro and Catalonia. The research analyses the use and integration of these programs in creative and productive processes based on 25 in-depth interviews with 13 directors and 12 creatives in both regions. The results show that agencies are using generative AI tools, but for different purposes, and that in some cases, AI is related to the advertising creation process, while in others, it is used for tasks related to the design of strategic communication plans or even the design of prototypes and models. Although there is unanimous agreement on the benefits of AI, there are concerns about ethical issues and its use in the finalists' work. This article allows us to glimpse new lines of research related to the implementation of generative AI tools in advertising creativity, customer relationship management, and advertising production.},

    abstract = {Introduction
This study aims to evaluate and compare the performance of three advanced chatbots—ChatGPT-4 Omni (ChatGPT-4o), DeepSeek, and Gemini Advanced—on answering questions related to pulp therapies for immature permanent teeth. The primary outcomes assessed were accuracy, completeness, and readability, while secondary outcomes focused on response time and potential correlations between these parameters.
Methods
A total of 21 questions were developed based on clinical resources provided by the American Association of Endodontists, including position statements, clinical considerations, and treatment options guides, and assessed by three experienced pediatric dentists and three endodontists. Accuracy and completeness scores, as well as response times, were recorded, and readability was evaluated using Flesch Kincaid Reading Ease Score, Flesch Kincaid Grade Level, Gunning Fog Score, SMOG Index, and Coleman Liau Index.
Results
Results revealed significant differences in accuracy (P < .05) and completeness (P < .05) scores among the chatbots, with ChatGPT-4o and DeepSeek outperforming Gemini Advanced in both categories. Significant differences in response times were also observed, with Gemini Advanced providing the quickest responses (P < .001). Additionally, correlations were found between accuracy and completeness scores (ρ: .719, P < .001), while response time showed a positive correlation with completeness (ρ: .144, P < .05). No significant correlation was found between accuracy and readability (P > .05).
Conclusions
ChatGPT-4o and DeepSeek demonstrated superior performance in terms of accuracy and completeness when compared to Gemini Advanced. Regarding readability, DeepSeek scored the highest, while ChatGPT-4o showed the lowest. These findings highlight the importance of considering both the quality and readability of artificial intelligence-driven responses, in addition to response time, in clinical applications.},

In contrast to many existing artificial intelligence models, generative pretrained transformer models can perform with very limited training data. Generative pretrained transformer 3 (GPT-3) is one of the latest releases in this pipeline, demonstrating human-like logical and intellectual responses to prompts. Some examples include writing essays, answering complex questions, matching pronouns to their nouns, and conducting sentiment analyses. However, questions remain with regard to its implementation in health care, specifically in terms of operationalization and its use in clinical practice and research. In this viewpoint paper, we briefly introduce GPT-3 and its capabilities and outline considerations for its implementation and operationalization in clinical practice through a use case. The implementation considerations include (1) processing needs and information systems infrastructure, (2) operating costs, (3) model biases, and (4) evaluation metrics. In addition, we outline the following three major operational factors that drive the adoption of GPT-3 in the US health care system: (1) ensuring Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act compliance, (2) building trust with health care providers, and (3) establishing broader access to the GPT-3 tools. This viewpoint can inform health care practitioners, developers, clinicians, and decision makers toward understanding the use of the powerful artificial intelligence tools integrated into hospital systems and health care.},

We report a critical examination of the advantages of generalist CAI in delivering health information, with a case of its operationalization during the COVID-19 pandemic and propose the strategic deployment of these technologies in collaboration with public health agencies. In addition, we address significant challenges and ethical considerations, such as AI biases, misinformation, privacy concerns, and the required regulatory oversight. We envision a future with leverages generalist CAI in messaging apps, proposing a multiagent approach to enhance the reliability and specificity of health communications. We hope this commentary initiates the necessary conversations and research toward building evaluation approaches, adaptive strategies, and robust legal and technical frameworks to fully realize the benefits of AI-enhanced communications in public health, aiming to ensure equitable and effective health outcomes across diverse populations.},

Teledermatology expands dermatologic care to remote and underserved areas, and AI technologies show considerable potential in analyzing dermatologic images and performing various tasks involved in teledermatology consultations. Such integration facilitates rapid, precise diagnoses, personalized treatment plans, and data-driven insights. Our explorative study involved designing a GPT-based chatbot named “Dr. DermBot” and exploring its performance in a teledermatologic consultation process.

    abstract = {The unprecedented popularity of Generative Artificial Intelligence (henceforth “GenAI”) tools like ChatGPT and Gemini has the potential to disrupt the education sector in general. The initial reactions from educators have drawn a mixed response about the application of GenAI in management education, where some consider it a ‘watershed’ phenomenon, while others consider it an ‘existential threat’ to the teaching-learning system. Subscribing to the positive view, this paper argues that educators must promote the responsible use of AI-based tools, and imposing any artificial restraint on the application of GenAI technology can be deleterious to students' advancement. This is because GenAI will automate future jobs and create new jobs that do not exist today. As organizations are moving towards skill-based hiring, management education must prepare graduates with the requisite technical and human skills required for future jobs. However, previous studies have invested a lot of attention towards the technical aspect of the integration of GenAI tools by recommending capacity development programs to understand the nuances of new technology. However, they have overlooked the important aspect of adopting technology, i.e., attitudes and behavioral rigidities among educators. For this purpose, we argue that to overcome such a rigid mindset, institutions must focus on an unlearning mechanism comprising three phases: destabilizing triggers, discarding existing practices, and experimenting with new ones to help educators adopt GenAI tools in the education system. This study offers multiple theoretical and practical implications. It is a response to a call from researchers to apply existing theories to inform management scholarship about the implementation of GenAI technology and overcome educators' apprehensions that impede the ethical application of GenAI in management education.},

    abstract = {Introduction: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited condition that reduces life expectancy and has a profound impact on quality of life. Assessment of social media conversations in the SCD community in the UK highlighted health inequities, including issues with access to emergency care, low levels of healthcare professional empathy, and racial bias/stigmatization (Shastri O, et al. ASH 2023; abstract 1057). This emphasizes the urgent unmet need for additional education. Use of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) to facilitate the development of medical content, including plain language summaries (PLS) of research may increase efficiency, reduce resource cost and ultimately improve accessibility to educational information across a range of audiences. We assessed the ability of GenAI to develop a PLS of our social media listening study. Methods: We developed 3 written versions of a PLS of this study: human-written by a medical writer, AI-generated, and hybrid AI-human, where a person living with SCD edited the AI version for readability. Each was ~300-400 words and with a target reading age of 12 years. The AI PLS was developed using Pfizer's GenAI tool, MAIA (Medical AI assistant). A video version of each written PLS was developed using the AI tool, Synthesia. People with SCD and their carers (≥18 years of age) were recruited via telephone to complete an online survey to assess the understandability of the 3 written PLS and preference for written versus video PLS. Participants were presented with 1 of the 3 written PLS at random and asked to assess how easily they understood it on a 5-point scale (1=very difficult; 2=difficult; 3=neither difficult nor easy; 4=easy; 5=very easy). They were then asked 3 multiple-choice questions to gauge their understanding. Participants then rated the other 2 written PLS and were asked to rank all 3 in order of most easily understood. Finally, participants watched the video version of their top-rated written PLS and stated which format they preferred. Participants were blinded to PLS source. The Flesch-Kincaid calculator (https://goodcalculators.com/flesch-kincaid-calculator/) was used to provide an objective measure of readability for each PLS. Results: Of 93 participants, there were 88 living with SCD and 5 caring for someone with SCD. The AI versions of the PLS achieved similar scores for understandability to the human-written version: mean ± standard deviation understandability scores were 4.1 ± 0.9 (human), 4.0 ± 0.9 (AI), and 3.9 ± 0.8 (AI-hybrid). Overall, 81% of participants identified the human PLS as easy or very easy to read, similar to 76% for the AI PLS, and 74% for the AI-hybrid PLS. Overall, 41 participants (44%) ranked the human PLS in first place for understandability, 31 (33%) the AI PLS, and 21 (23%) the AI-hybrid PLS. For the multiple-choice questions, results were similar regardless of which PLS participants saw first, with over 85% correctly identifying the main findings of the study and the conclusions of the author; however, 63% incorrectly thought the data on which the PLS was based were obtained from interviewing people affected by SCD rather than social media listening. Fifty-four participants (58%) preferred the video PLS over the written PLS, 27 participants (29%) preferred the written PLS and 12 (13%) had no preference. Flesch-Kincaid scores for the three PLS were as follows: human (reading ease score, 62; reading level, 8th to 9th grade); AI (reading ease score, 58; reading level, 10th to 12th grade); AI-hybrid (reading ease score, 63; reading level, 8th to 9th grade). Conclusion: There is a clear need for additional resources and education in SCD, which may be supported by the development of PLS. The limited studies that have assessed the capabilities of AI to generate PLS to date have focussed on clinical research. We have now expanded this to assess use of AI to develop PLS from a social media listening study that evaluated real-world experiences of the UK SCD community. Our study suggests that GenAI can generate PLS that are as informative as conventional, human-written PLS, and achieve similar readability scores as judged by people living with SCD in the UK (mean 4.1 for human-written, 4.0 for AI and 3.9 for AI-hybrid). We propose that GenAI may offer an alternative to conventional human-written PLS, providing a time- and resource-efficient solution to increase accessibility to educational resources.},

Using panel data from Chinese A-share listed companies covering the period 2010–2023 and a firm-level AI indicator derived from patent information, we empirically examine this relationship and explore the underlying mechanisms. Our findings indicate the following: (1) A firm's AI level significantly enhances its investment efficiency. This conclusion remains robust across a series of robustness checks. (2) Mechanism analysis indicates that AI primarily enhances investment efficiency by improving internal information processing efficiency. (3) Heterogeneity analysis reveals that the positive effect of AI on investment efficiency is more pronounced in firms with longer listing histories (more mature firms) and in non-state-owned enterprises. This research contributes micro-level evidence regarding the economic consequences of AI from a corporate investment perspective.},

    abstract = {Background
This study aimed to examine the usage, awareness, and satisfaction related to generative AI (GenAI) among undergraduate students at a Traditional Korean Medicine (TKM) college in Korea and to identify factors associated with GenAI use and satisfaction.
Methods
A structured questionnaire consisting of 56 items across six domains was administered, covering demographics, general and TKM-specific GenAI use, satisfaction, educational experiences, and future expectations. Descriptive statistics, univariable analysis, multivariable logistic regression, and correlation analysis were performed.
Results
A total of 234 students across six academic years participated in the survey. Most respondents were aware of GenAI (88.5 %) and used it for general purposes (79.9 %). However, only 16.2 % actively used it for TKM learning. While 70.4 % were satisfied with using GenAI in general, only 45.8 % felt satisfied with its use for TKM education. Factors significantly associated with GenAI use or satisfaction included enrollment in the TKM curriculum, older age, prior major, scholarship receipt, and self-directed GenAI learning. Although only 18.8 % had experienced GenAI in formal TKM courses, 96.2 % viewed GenAI as necessary in TKM education.
Conclusion
A notable gap exists between students’ interest and the limited integration of GenAI in TKM curricula. To close this gap, GenAI should be systematically incorporated into educational programs, accompanied by faculty training and institutional support to enhance students’ digital readiness and learning outcomes.},

This study investigated the response and readability of generative artificial intelligence (AI) models to questions and recommendations proposed by the 2023 Congress of Neurological Surgeons (CNS) guidelines for Chiari 1 malformation.
Methods
Thirteen questions were generated from CNS guidelines and asked to Perplexity, ChatGPT 4o, Microsoft Copilot, and Google Gemini. AI answers were divided into two categories, "concordant" and "non-concordant," according to their alignment with current CNS guidelines. Non-concordant answers were sub-categorized as “insufficient” or “over-conclusive.” Responses were evaluated for readability via the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, Gunning Fog Index, SMOG (Simple Measure of Gobbledygook) Index, and Flesch Reading Ease test.
Results
Perplexity displayed the highest concordance rate of 69.2 %, with non-concordant responses classified as 0 % insufficient and 30.8 % over-conclusive. ChatGPT 4o had the lowest concordance rate at 23.1 %, with 0 % insufficient and 76.9 % over-conclusive classifications. Copilot showed a 61.5 % concordance rate, with 7.7 % insufficient and 30.8 % over-conclusive. Gemini demonstrated a 30.8 % concordance rate, with 7.7 % insufficient and 61.5 % as over-conclusive. Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level scores ranged from 14.48 (Gemini) to 16.48 (Copilot), Gunning Fog Index scores varied between 16.18 (Gemini) and 18.8 (Copilot), SMOG Index scores ranged from 16 (Gemini) to 17.54 (Copilot), and Flesch Reading Ease scores were low across all models, with Gemini showing the highest mean score of 21.3.
Conclusion
Perplexity and Copilot emerged as the best-performing for concordance, while ChatGPT and Gemini displayed the highest over-conclusive rates. All responses showcased high complexity and difficult readability. While AI can be valuable in certain aspects of clinical practice, the low concordance rates show that AI should not replace clinician judgement.},

Global neurosurgery is a public health focus in neurosurgery that seeks to ensure safe, timely, and affordable neurosurgical care to all individuals worldwide. Although investigators have begun to explore the promise of artificial intelligence (AI) for neurosurgery, its applicability to global neurosurgery has been largely hypothetical. We characterize opportunities and considerations for the incorporation of AI into global neurosurgery by synthesizing key themes yielded from a series of generative pretrained transformers (GPTs), discuss important limitations of GPTs and cautions when using AI in neurosurgery, and develop a framework for the equitable incorporation of AI into global neurosurgery.
Methods
ChatGPT, Bing Chat/Copilot, You, Perplexity.ai, and Google Bard were queried with the prompt “How can AI be incorporated into global neurosurgery?” A layered ChatGPT-based thematic analysis was performed. The authors synthesized the results into opportunities and considerations for the incorporation of AI in global neurosurgery. A Pareto analysis was conducted to determine common themes.
Results
Eight opportunities and 14 important considerations were synthesized. Six opportunities related to patient care, 1 to education, and another to public health planning. Four of the important considerations were deemed specific to global neurosurgery. The Pareto analysis included all 8 opportunities and 5 considerations.
Conclusions
AI may be incorporated into global neurosurgery in a variety of capacities requiring numerous considerations. The framework presented in this manuscript may facilitate the incorporation of AI into global neurosurgery initiatives while balancing contextual factors and the reality of limited resources.},

Artificial intelligence (AI) has become increasingly used in neurosurgery. Generative pretrained transformers (GPTs) have been of particular interest. However, ethical concerns regarding the incorporation of AI into the field remain underexplored. We delineate key ethical considerations using a novel GPT-based, human-modified approach, synthesize the most common considerations, and present an ethical framework for the involvement of AI in neurosurgery.
Methods
GPT-4, ChatGPT, Bing Chat/Copilot, You, Perplexity.ai, and Google Bard were queried with the prompt “How can artificial intelligence be ethically incorporated into neurosurgery?”. Then, a layered GPT-based thematic analysis was performed. The authors synthesized the results into considerations for the ethical incorporation of AI into neurosurgery. Separate Pareto analyses with 20% threshold and 10% threshold were conducted to determine salient themes. The authors refined these salient themes.
Results
Twelve key ethical considerations focusing on stakeholders, clinical implementation, and governance were identified. Refinement of the Pareto analysis of the top 20% most salient themes in the aggregated GPT outputs yielded 10 key considerations. Additionally, from the top 10% most salient themes, 5 considerations were retrieved. An ethical framework for the use of AI in neurosurgery was developed.
Conclusions
It is critical to address the ethical considerations associated with the use of AI in neurosurgery. The framework described in this manuscript may facilitate the integration of AI into neurosurgery, benefitting both patients and neurosurgeons alike. We urge neurosurgeons to use AI only for validated purposes and caution against automatic adoption of its outputs without neurosurgeon interpretation.},

Existing studies often focus on specific domains without addressing broader trust-building mechanisms or the cognitive and motivational factors needed for sustained engagement. This study investigates how trust shapes the adoption of GAI-driven sustainability recommendations by integrating the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM) and Expectancy-Value Theory (EVT) into a single framework. Using data from sustainability-oriented users, we examine how central route constructs-perceived information quality and utility-peripheral route constructs-anthropomorphism and interaction quality-enhance trust, while perceived information complexity and perceived risk moderate these relationships. Our findings indicate that high-quality, useful information enhances trust through cognitive engagement, whereas anthropomorphic design and interaction quality reinforce trust via the heuristic route. However, excessive complexity and privacy concerns undermine trust, highlighting the need for clearer communication and data transparency. This study broadens theoretical understanding by extending ELM and EVT to the context of GAI-driven sustainability efforts, providing an integrated framework that encompasses cognitive and motivational trust drivers. These insights fill gaps in technology adoption research and offer practical guidance for developing GAI platforms that effectively support pro-environmental behavior change.},

AI integration in education is gaining interest, including in nursing, as students seek formal training on its healthcare applications and limitations.
Aim
To evaluate the predictive effect of nursing students' attitudes and acceptance of artificial intelligence on their clinical competencies.
Methods
This descriptive-correlational study was conducted at 2 universities (February–June 2024) with 441 nursing students. Full-time students in clinical practice participated; those absent or on leave were excluded. The Nursing Students Competency Scale, General Attitudes to Artificial Intelligence Scale, and Generative Artificial Intelligence Acceptance Scale were used. Descriptive statistics and linear regression were used.
Results
The main factors affecting nursing students' clinical competence were “facilitating conditions,” “social influence,” and “negative attitudes” toward AI. A weak correlation was found between positive AI attitudes and acceptance, which explained 8.6% of the competency levels.
Conclusion
Positive perceptions of AI may increase competence, while skepticism may deepen engagement and critical learning. Strategies to improve the acceptance and use of AI are crucial to maximize its benefits in nursing education and practice.},

Translating and summarizing, in plain language, the specialized terminology, intricate statistical models, and interdisciplinary knowledge inherent in this field presents significant challenges which have historically been addressed with human intermediaries and their associated cost and time. Freely available chat-enabled large language models offer the ability to automatically generate a range of cost-effective plain language summaries. These capabilities are accompanied by several limitations such as oversimplification and the risk of inaccuracies which must be considered. Also considered are the ethical considerations such as the need to emphasize transparency, cultural sensitivities, and mitigation of bias in generative AI outputs. The importance of human quality assurance in maintaining scientific accuracy, context, and public trust is critical to responsible applications of this approach. By advocating for a balanced approach that leverages AI's scalability while preserving scientific rigor, this chapter promotes the thoughtful integration of AI in environmental toxicology research translation, ultimately envisioning its role in enhancing public understanding, informing policy, and fostering equitable access to scientific knowledge. An illustrative case exercise provides a step-by-step process for creating these summaries.},

    abstract = {Purpose
This study examines consumers' evaluations of product consumption values, purchase intentions and willingness to pay for fashion products designed using generative adversarial network (GAN), an artificial intelligence technology. This research investigates differences between consumers' evaluations of a GAN-generated product and a non-GAN-generated product and tests whether disclosing the use of GAN technology affects consumers' evaluations.
Design/methodology/approach
Sample products were developed as experimental stimuli using cycleGAN. Data were collected from 163 members of Generation Y. Participants were assigned to one of the three experimental conditions (i.e. non-GAN-generated images, GAN-generated images with disclosure and GAN-generated images without disclosure). Regression analysis and ANOVA were used to test the hypotheses.
Findings
Functional, social and epistemic consumption values positively affect willingness to pay in the GAN-generated products. Relative to non-GAN-generated products, willingness to pay is significantly higher for GAN-generated products. Moreover, evaluations of functional value, emotional value and willingness to pay are highest when GAN technology is used, but not disclosed.
Originality/value
This study evaluates the utility of GANs from consumers' perspective based on the perceived value of GAN-generated product designs. Findings have practical implications for firms that are considering using GANs to develop products for the retail fashion market.},

Currently, clinicians using chatbots without appropriate approval risk undermining legal protections for patients. This could harm the patient and undermine the standards of the profession, undermining trust in an area where human involvement in decision-making is critical. To explore these concerns, this paper is divided into three parts. First, it examines the needs of patients in mental health. Second, it explores the potential benefits of GenAI in mental health and highlights the risks of its use as it pertains to patient needs. Third, it notes the ethical and legal concerns around data use and medical liability that require careful attention. The impact of the European Union's (EU) Artificial Intelligence Act (AI-Act) is also considered. It will be seen that these laws are insufficient in the context of mental health.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is progressively reshaping the way that researchers design and study highly complex systems. In this perspective, we introduce an engineering design methodology aimed at fostering creativity through “constructive dialogues with a generative AI” and exemplify its potential through a set of methodically developed case studies. This creativity promotion approach starts with computer-aided design (CAD) models of lattices, metamaterials, and architected materials, which are provided as initial inputs to a generative AI through a chat. Then, the conversation starts with researchers asking the generative AI to modify the provided CAD model images by incorporating new elements, placing them in quasi-real-life environments, or adapting the provided designs to the structures of new products. To illustrate the methodology, a varied set of selected case studies of constructive dialogues leading to highly innovative designs are provided, bridging the gap between tissue engineering scaffolds and building architectures, biohybrid materials and product design, and innovative structures and medical devices, to cite a few.},

    abstract = {Aims
This study aimed to explore the effects of interactive teaching strategies based on generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) under the guidance of outcome-based education (OBE) theory on higher-order thinking skills (HOTS) and artificial intelligence (AI) literacy of undergraduate nursing students.
Background
Recently, GenAI-assisted teaching has been widely recognised as a trend in nursing education reform. HOTS and AI literacy are important for nursing students in the era of artificial intelligence. However, studies on the use of GenAI to enhance the HOTS and AI literacy of undergraduate nursing students are limited.
Design
A quasi-experimental study.
Methods
Based on OBE theory, interactive teaching strategies using GenAI were introduced into a nursing course. Overall, 132 third-year nursing undergraduates enrolled in this course were randomly divided into experimental (n = 66) and control groups (n = 66).
Results
After completing the course, the HOTS scores of nursing undergraduates (P = 0.018) and AI literacy (P < 0.001) in the experimental group were significantly better than those in the control group. There was a significant difference in the HOTS scores (P < 0.001) and AI literacy (P < 0.001) between the experimental group before and after the course.
Conclusion
GenAI-assisted teaching could help nursing undergraduates improve their HOTS and AI literacy. As an important auxiliary teaching tool, GenAI should be integrated into other nursing courses and widely applied in nursing education in the future.},

Gastroenterology and hepatology in particular will be transformed due to the multimodal workflows that integrate endoscopic video, radiologic imaging, tabular data, and unstructured note text. GenAI will impact the entire spectrum of clinical experience, from administrative tasks, diagnostic guidance, and treatment recommendations. Unlike traditional machine learning approaches, genAI is more flexible, with one platform able to be used across multiple tasks. Initial evidence suggests benefits in lower-level administrative tasks, such as clinical documentation, medical billing, and scheduling; and information tasks, such as patient education and summarization of the medical literature. No evidence exists for genAI solutions for more complex tasks relevant to clinical care, such as clinical reasoning for diagnostic and treatment decisions that may affect patient outcomes. Challenges of output reliability, data privacy, and useful integration remain; potential solutions include robust validation, regulatory oversight, and "human–AI teaming" strategies to ensure safe, effective deployment. We remain optimistic in the potential of genAI to augment clinical expertise due to the adaptability of genAI to handle multiple data modalities to obtain and focus relevant information flows and the human-friendly interfaces that facilitate ease of use.

    abstract = {The implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) has been instrumental in the optimization of friction stir welding (FSW) parameters. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, including artificial neural networks (ANN) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS), were utilized to predict mechanical properties such as ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and optimize pivotal welding parameters, such as rotational speed, feed rate, axial force, and tilt angle. These methodologies enabled precise real-time control, thus improving the quality and consistency of the resulting welded joints. The objective of this study was to conduct a comprehensive review of the application of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques in friction stir welding (FSW). The objective of the study was to synthesize existing research using AI to predict mechanical properties and optimize welding parameters. Furthermore, the study aimed to illustrate how artificial intelligence has improved the caliber and dependability of FSW joints through real-time observation and defect identification. A systematic literature review was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines to identify relevant studies on the utilization of AI in FSW. A search algorithm was applied to databases such as ScienceDirect and Web of Science, resulting in the identification of 27 relevant scientific papers. The selection criteria were designed to identify studies that employed AI techniques for the prediction and optimization of FSW parameters. The principal findings indicated the pervasive deployment of 34 distinct AI techniques, with ANN being the most prevalent. Hybrid models combining AI with optimization algorithms, such as particle swarm optimization (PSO) and genetic algorithms, were particularly effective. These models demonstrated high precision in predicting tensile strength and detecting internal defects, significantly improving joint quality. In conclusion, AI applications in FSW have proven essential for optimizing welding processes, with hybrid AI models showing superior performance. The continued integration of AI in FSW is expected to enhance the efficiency and reliability of welding operations, offering significant industrial advantages.},

The goal of this project was to evaluate the feasibility of using artificial intelligence (AI) in grading pharmacy Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) analytical checklists in terms of accuracy, objectivity and consistency, and efficiency compared to faculty evaluators.
Methods
Third-year pharmacy students (n = 39) enrolled in a private Christian university completed a 5-station OSCE as part of the Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experience-readiness plan. Audio recordings from 2 of the interactive stations were de-identified and fed into 2 customized language learning models: a speech-to-text and a tailored transformer model trained on the analytical checklist. A validation set using the analytical checklist was completed by the study investigator. Comparison of AI scoring of the analytical checklist against the validation set and faculty evaluators' scoring was retrospectively reviewed for analysis.
Results
The customized AI model demonstrated >96% and 94% accuracy for stations A and B, respectively. There was an observed statistically significant inter-rater variability among the faculty evaluators, with one evaluator scoring on average 4 points higher in one station and another evaluator scoring on average one point higher in the second station. For efficiency, the AI model graded 39 students in <5 min, saving time for faculty grading, along with timely feedback to assist in improving future student performance.
Conclusion
Customized AI model outperformed faculty scoring on the pharmacy OSCE analytical checklists of 2 stations in accuracy, objectivity and consistency, and efficiency.},

Background
Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, has expanded across various fields, including medical education and professional applications. However, the extent to which AI is utilized in writing personal statements (PSs) for adult reconstruction fellowship applications remains unclear. This study aimed to analyze the prevalence of AI-generated text in PSs submitted to our institution before and after the release of ChatGPT.
Methods
We retrospectively reviewed PSs submitted to our institution’s adult reconstruction fellowship from 2021 to 2025. The PSs were divided into two cohorts: Pre-PS (2021 to 2022) and Post-PS (2024 to 2025). The PSs from 2023 were excluded due to uncertainty in AI adoption. All PSs were analyzed using GPTZero, an AI detection software, to determine the proportion of AI-generated versus human-generated text. Descriptive statistics and comparative analyses were conducted.
Results
A total of 421 PSs were analyzed. The Pre-PS cohort had an average GPTZero score of 99.5% (SD 1.9) human, 0.4% (SD 0.8) AI, and 0.1% (SD 1.8) mixed, while the Post-PS cohort had scores of 83.8% (SD 29.9) human, 15.1% (SD 28.9) AI, and 1.1% mixed (SD 5.2) (P < 0.001). The AI-generated text was significantly more prevalent in the Post-PS cohort compared to the Pre-PS cohort. Additionally, international medical graduates (IMGs) and applicants from non-U.S. residencies demonstrated a higher proportion of AI-generated text in their PSs compared to U.S. applicants (P < 0.001).
Conclusion
The use of AI in PS writing has increased significantly since the release of ChatGPT. Given the role of PSs in candidate selection, these findings highlight the need for transparency, standardized guidelines regarding AI-assisted writing, and re-evaluation of the importance placed on personal statements in candidate selection. Further research should expand to other subspecialties and institutions to assess the broader implications of AI in postgraduate medical education.},

    abstract = {Purpose
The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) in health care comes with increasing concerns about the use and integrity of the information it generates. Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (ChatGPT) 3.5, Google Gemini, and Bing Copilot are free AI chatbot platforms that may be used for answering medical questions and disseminating medical information. Given that carpal tunnel syndrome accounts for 90% of all neuropathies, it is important to understand the accuracy of the information patients may be receiving. The purpose of this study is to determine the use and accuracy of responses generated by ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and Bing Copilot in answering frequently asked questions about carpal tunnel syndrome.
Methods
Two independent authors scored responses using the DISCERN tool. DISCERN consists of 15 questions assessing health information on a five-point scale, with total scores ranging from 15 to 75 points. Then, a two-factor analysis of variance was conducted, with scorer and chatbot type as the factors.
Results
One-way analysis of variance revealed no significant difference in DISCERN scores among the three chatbots. The chatbots each scored in the “fair” range, with means of 45 for ChatGPT, 48 for Bing Copilot, and 46 for Google Gemini. The average Journal of the American Medical Association score for ChatGPT and Google Gemini surpassed that of Bing Copilot, with averages of 2.3, 2.3, and 1.8, respectively.
Conclusions
ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and Bing Copilot platforms generated relatively reliable answers for potential patient questions about carpal tunnel syndrome. However, users should continue to be aware of the shortcomings of the information provided, given the lack of citations, potential for misconstrued information, and perpetuated biases that inherently come with using such platforms. Future studies should explore the response quality for less common orthopedic pathologies and assess patient perceptions of response readability to determine the value of AI as a patient resource across the medical field.

It was found that the binding interfaces in distinctive protein complexes are highly similar. The structural properties underlying different binding interfaces could be further captured by artificial intelligence. In order to test this hypothesis, we broke protein-protein binding interfaces into pairs of interacting fragments. We employed a generative model to encode these interface fragment pairs in a low-dimensional latent space. After training, new conformations of interface fragment pairs were generated. We found that, by only using a small number of interface fragment pairs that were generated by artificial intelligence, we were able to guide the assembly of protein complexes into their native conformations. These results demonstrate that the conformational space of fragment pairs at protein-protein binding interfaces is highly degenerate. Features in this degenerate space can be well characterized by artificial intelligence. In summary, our machine learning method will be potentially useful to search for and predict the conformations of unknown protein-protein interactions.},

    abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has witnessed a major boom in recent years and is increasingly penetrating the higher education sector. This study focused on the use of ChatGPT by undergraduate management students. We developed a model called the “AI Student Satisfaction with Studies model” (AI 3S-model) to investigate how generative AI, specifically ChatGPT, affects student satisfaction with their management studies. Factors used in the model included AI-related student expectations, AI-related student job expectations, perceived quality of AI among students, and AI-related overall student satisfaction. An online questionnaire was administered to students from economics faculties at various universities in the Czech Republic. We deliberately focused on one specialized economics college and several large economics faculties. The sample comprised 231 respondents. To analyze the data, we applied covariance-based structural equation modelling using maximum likelihood estimation. Our findings indicate that two factors directly and positively affect overall student satisfaction with AI use: their perceived quality of studies and their expectations. Additionally, perceived quality acts as a significant mediator between student expectations and overall satisfaction, as well as between job expectations and overall satisfaction. Students believe that ChatGPT enhances their quality of education, which boosts their overall satisfaction. For management education programs, this means that finding ways to effectively integrate generative AI into students’ learning and establishing reasonable limits is highly beneficial, whereas prohibiting the use of generative AI tools would likely decrease student satisfaction and diminish the perceived quality of their studies.},

This mixed-methods exploratory study investigated how Chinese EAL students perceived and used GenAI, and how these attitudes and behaviors reflected their Critical Language Awareness (CLA). Survey data were collected from 320 Chinese undergraduate and graduate students studying in China and abroad, supplemented by in-depth semi-structured interviews with five volunteers. Quantitative findings revealed that, while participants valued GenAI for reducing language barriers and enhancing writing mechanics, they remained wary of issues related to originality, transparency, and ethical accountability. Qualitative analysis further illuminated participants' emerging CLA, evident in their negotiations of power (managing overreliance and misinformation), ideology (navigating dominant academic norms), and social justice (acknowledging cultural biases encoded in GenAI training data). Although students were primarily motivated by pragmatic benefits, such as improved grammar, structure, and efficiency, they also recognized GenAI's potential to perpetuate monolingual, Western-centric perspectives. These results underscore the need to embed CLA principles in GenAI-assisted pedagogy. By encouraging students to critically interrogate GenAI outputs, question linguistic hierarchies, and reflect on sociocultural contexts, educators can better leverage GenAI's affordances while fostering ethical, culturally responsive, and equitable writing practices.},

@article{SUPPAN2025,
    abstract = {Background
Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is showing great promise as a tool to optimize decision-making across various fields, including medicine. In anesthesiology, accurately calculating maximum safe doses of local anesthetics (LAs) is crucial to prevent complications such as local anesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST). Current methods for determining LA dosage are largely based on empirical guidelines and clinician experience, which can result in significant variability and dosing errors. AI models may offer a solution, by processing multiple parameters simultaneously to suggest adequate LA doses.
Objective
This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 3 generative AI models, ChatGPT (OpenAI), Copilot (Microsoft Corporation), and Gemini (Google LLC), in calculating maximum safe LA doses, with the goal of determining their potential use in clinical practice.
Methods
A comparative analysis was conducted using a 51-item questionnaire designed to assess LA dose calculation across 10 simulated clinical vignettes. The responses generated by ChatGPT, Copilot, and Gemini were compared with reference doses calculated using a scientifically validated set of rules. Quantitative evaluations involved comparing AI-generated doses to these reference doses, while qualitative assessments were conducted by independent reviewers using a 5-point Likert scale.
Results
All 3 AI models (Gemini, ChatGPT, and Copilot) completed the questionnaire and generated responses aligned with LA dose calculation principles, but their performance in providing safe doses varied significantly. Gemini frequently avoided proposing any specific dose, instead recommending consultation with a specialist. When it did provide dose ranges, they often exceeded safe limits by 140% (SD 103%) in cases involving mixtures. ChatGPT provided unsafe doses in 90% (9/10) of cases, exceeding safe limits by 198% (SD 196%). Copilot’s recommendations were unsafe in 67% (6/9) of cases, exceeding limits by 217% (SD 239%). Qualitative assessments rated Gemini as “fair” and both ChatGPT and Copilot as “poor.”
Conclusions
Generative AI models like Gemini, ChatGPT, and Copilot currently lack the accuracy and reliability needed for safe LA dose calculation. Their poor performance suggests that they should not be used as decision-making tools for this purpose. Until more reliable AI-driven solutions are developed and validated, clinicians should rely on their expertise, experience, and a careful assessment of individual patient factors to guide LA dosing and ensure patient safety.},

This study aims to compare student-generated nursing care plans with ChatGPT-generated care planning texts for patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy surgery.
Background
Given the increasing significance of technology in nursing education, the integration of AI-driven tools into educational methodologies demonstrates potential for enhancing nursing students' preparation for clinical practice by providing access to more comprehensive and current information sources.
Methods
This descriptive comparative study evaluated 14 nursing care plans developed by nursing students for laparoscopic cholecystectomy patients alongside care plans generated by ChatGPT for identical patient scenarios, using the DISCERN scale as the assessment instrument.
Results
The quality of student-generated care plans was determined to be satisfactory, whereas the quality of ChatGPT-generated texts was assessed as moderate. Both student care plans and ChatGPT-generated texts demonstrated moderate reliability and information quality regarding nursing care. Students exhibited the highest accuracy rate in formulating correct nursing diagnoses (90.22 %), while ChatGPT-generated texts demonstrated superior performance in correctly establishing nursing goals (90.35 %) and developing appropriate nursing interventions (91.07 %).
Conclusions
The findings indicate that while student-generated care plans demonstrated generally acceptable quality, ChatGPT's performance in this domain was moderate, particularly in formulating surgical nursing goals and interventions. Although clinical outcomes were not evaluated in this study, the results suggest that ChatGPT may serve as a valuable supplementary resource for surgical nursing education and care plan development. Further research is warranted to determine its impact on patient care quality and clinical effectiveness.},

A systematic review methodology, following PRISMA-ScR guidelines, was employed to analyse studies from 2017 to 2025, identifying the AI algorithms most frequently used to personalise gaming experiences, improve patient engagement, and increase treatment efficacy. Our proposal categorises the algorithms based on their role in the game environment, which can either be game control or user assessment. Game control algorithms adapt the game environment and difficulty, while user assessment algorithms gather information about the player's state, such as performance, mood, or physiological data, to evaluate the treatment progress. The review also examines the growing trend of using multimodal data as input for machine learning models. Results show that a few well-known algorithms, such as Decision Trees (DT), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Fuzzy Logic (FL), Naïve Bayes (NB), and Support Vector Machines (SVM), are frequently used. However, there is a clear distinction in their purposes: while FL is typically applied to game control tasks, SVMs are mainly used for user assessment. This review offers valuable insights for researchers in the field, providing a comprehensive overview of the suitability of different AI algorithms for various tasks in SGs, with a particular focus on personalisation and motivation.},

@article{TEO2025106134,
    abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasing being deployed across various sectors in society. While bringing progress and promise to scientific discovery, public administration, healthcare, transportation and human well-being generally, artificial intelligence can also exacerbate existing forms of human vulnerabilities and can introduce new vulnerabilities through the interplay of AI inferences, predictions and content that is generated. This underpins the anxiety of policymakers in terms of managing potential harms and vulnerabilities and the harried landscape of governance and regulatory modalities, including through the European Union’s effort to be the first in the world to comprehensively regulate AI. This article examines the adequacy of the existing theories of human vulnerability in countering the challenges posed by artificial intelligence, including through how vulnerability is theorised and addressed within human rights law and within existing legislative efforts such as the EU AI Act. Vulnerability is an element that informs the contours of groups and populations that are protected, for example under non-discrimination law and privacy law. A critical evaluation notes that while human vulnerability is taken into account in governing and regulating AI systems, the vulnerability lens that informs legal responses is one that is particularistic, static and identifiable. In other words, the law demands that vulnerabilities are known in advance in order for meaningful parameters of protection to be designed around them. The individual, as the subject of legal protection, is also expected to be able to identify the harms suffered and therein seek for accountability. However, AI can displace this straightforward framing and the legal certainty that implicitly underpins how vulnerabilities are dealt with under the law. Through data-driven inferential insights of predictive AI systems and content generation enabled by general purpose AI models, novel forms of dynamic, unforeseeable and emergent forms of vulnerability can arise that cannot be adequately encompassed within existing legal responses. Instead, it requires an expansion of not only the types of legal responses offered but also of vulnerability theory itself and the measures of resilience that should be taken to address the exacerbation of existing vulnerabilities and but also of emergent ones. The article offers a re-theorisation of human vulnerability in the age of AI as one informed by the universalist idea of vulnerability theorised by Martha Fineman. A new conceptual framework is offered, through an expanded understanding that sketches out the human condition in this age as one of ‘algorithmic vulnerability.’ It finds support for this new condition through a vector of convergence from the growing vocabularies of harm, the regulatory direction and drawing from scholarship on emerging vulnerabilities. The article proposes the framework of multi-level resilience to account for existing and emerging vulnerabilities. It offers a typology, examining how resilience towards vulnerabilities can be operationalised at the level of the individual, through technological design and within regulatory initiatives and other measures that promote societal resilience. The article also addresses objections to this new framing, namely in terms of how it seemingly results in a problem with no agency, potentially negating fault ascription and blame. Further, it addresses if the re-conception itself falls into the trap of technological determinism and finally, how the universalist notion of vulnerability can seemingly negate human autonomy that is a key feature of human dignity.},

Then, based on the general prompt framework of LLMs, schema for aircraft conceptual design solutions, and real-world design cases, task prompts for generating aircraft conceptual design solutions are crafted, resulting in three types of prompts: Full-Instruction, 1-Shot, and 5-Shot. Finally, the prototype system is utilized to design conceptual solutions, and the model-generated solutions are compared with those designed by engineers from both objective and subjective perspectives. The experimental results indicate that LLMs demonstrate conceptual design capabilities comparable to those of engineers, exhibiting strong generalization ability and potential for innovative design.},

Nurses’ clinical research activities have contributed to optimizing the care process and improving patient outcomes, and generative artificial intelligence (GAI) may help clinical nurses strengthen their research skills. To support research, this study aimed to explore the Chinese nurses’ perceptions and experiences of GAI training.
Methods
This study used a descriptive qualitative design. The China Nurses Network conducted a three-day training session on “GAI for Nursing Research” theme, we selected 23 nurses by a convenience sampling method among participating in the training. The researchers conducted three focus group interviews at the end of each day. All focus groups were interviewed face-to-face to facilitate interaction, data collection, and observation. The data were analyzed using conventional content analysis and coded manually.
Results
The results showed that nurses’ use of GAI to support scientific research was dynamic and characterized by evolving perceptions and practices. Four themes and 11 sub-themes emerged from the analysis: 1) utilization efficacy: cope with research ability, affected by many factors; 2) booster research: growth and challenges go hand in hand; 3) role reversal: from GAI-dominated to nurse-dominated; 4) beautiful dream: more features on research, more assistants on clinical care.
Conclusions
The effectiveness of GAI in supporting clinical nurses in conducting research is mainly limited by differences in personal research literacy, lack of ethical regulation, and information accuracy. In the future, it is necessary to improve nurses’ relevant skills through specialized training and promote the standardization of technical regulations to ensure the appropriate application of GAI in nursing research.},

    abstract = {Aim
The aim of this paper is to investigate the incorporation of visual narratives, such as comics and graphics, into nursing education using Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) models like DALL-E.
Background
Visual narratives serve as a powerful method for communicating intricate concepts in nursing education. Despite their advantages, challenges in creating effective educational comics persist due to the need for expertise in graphic design and the associated time and resource constraints.
Design
This study examines existing literature that highlights the efficacy of visual narratives in education and demonstrates the potential of GAI models, specifically DALL-E, in creating visual narratives for nursing education.
Methods
We analyze the potential of GAI models, specifically DALL-E, to create visual narratives for educational purposes. This was demonstrated through illustrative examples addressing sensitive topics, illustrating research methodology and designing recruitment posters for clinical trials. Additionally, we discussed the necessity of reviewing and editing the text generated by DALL-E to ensure its accuracy and relevance in educational contexts. The method also considered legal concerns related to copyright and ownership of the generated content, highlighting the evolving legal landscape in this domain.
Results
The study found that GAI, specifically DALL-E, has significant potential to bridge the gap in creating visual narratives for nursing education. While offering cost-effectiveness and accessibility, GAI tools require careful consideration of challenges such as text-related errors, misinterpretation of user prompts and legal concerns.
Conclusions
GAI models like DALL-E offer promising solutions for enhancing visual storytelling in nursing education. However, their effective integration requires a collaborative approach, where educators engage with these tools as co-pilots, leveraging their capabilities while mitigating potential drawbacks. By doing so, educators can harness the full potential of GAI to enrich the educational experience for learners through compelling visual narratives.},

    abstract = {Most applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) are designed for a confined and specific task. However, there are many scenarios that call for a more general AI, capable of solving a wide array of tasks without being specifically designed for them. The term General Purpose Artificial Intelligence Systems (GPAIS) has been defined to refer to these AI systems. To date, the possibility of an Artificial General Intelligence, powerful enough to perform any intellectual task as if it were human, or even improve it, has remained an aspiration, fiction, and considered a risk for our society. Whilst we might still be far from achieving that, GPAIS is a reality and sitting at the forefront of AI research. This work discusses existing definitions for GPAIS and proposes a new definition that allows for a gradual differentiation among types of GPAIS according to their properties and limitations. We distinguish between closed-world and open-world GPAIS, characterising their degree of autonomy and ability based on several factors such as adaptation to new tasks, competence in domains not intentionally trained for, ability to learn from few data, or proactive acknowledgement of their own limitations. We then propose a taxonomy of approaches to realise GPAIS, describing research trends such as the use of AI techniques to improve another AI (commonly referred to as AI-powered AI) or (single) foundation models. As a prime example, we delve into generative AI (GenAI), aligning them with the terms and concepts presented in the taxonomy. Similarly, we explore the challenges and prospects of multi-modality, which involves fusing various types of data sources to expand the capabilities of GPAIS. Through the proposed definition and taxonomy, our aim is to facilitate research collaboration across different areas that are tackling general purpose tasks, as they share many common aspects. Finally, with the goal of providing a holistic view of GPAIS, we discuss the current state of GPAIS, its prospects, implications for our society, and the need for regulation and governance of GPAIS to ensure their responsible and trustworthy development.},

    abstract = {Background
Artificial intelligence has emerged as a promising tool to optimize patient care in the field of cardiovascular medicine. However, data on its adoption and utilization by healthcare professionals are scarce.
Aim
To explore the factors that support or hinder the adoption of artificial intelligence in cardiology in France.
Methods
The INSIGHT-AI France study is a two-wave longitudinal panel survey recontacting the same individuals after 12 months, targeting professionals involved in the management of patients with cardiovascular diseases, including senior cardiologists, residents, nurses, technicians, engineers and decision-makers involved in artificial intelligence development. Participants from academic, public non-academic and private hospitals were recruited using a stratified sampling approach to capture diverse perspectives. Data were collected via SKEZIA, a platform compliant with the General Data Protection Regulation, with secure authentication and longitudinal tracking capabilities. The baseline survey, distributed from December 2024 to March 2025, assessed knowledge, attitudes, beliefs and practices related to artificial intelligence in cardiology. A follow-up survey will be conducted 12 months later to evaluate changes over time. The survey was developed by a scientific committee, with feedback from artificial intelligence and cardiology experts, and was pilot-tested for feasibility. Statistical analyses will include mixed-effects models and regression analyses.
Conclusions
This is the first study designed to explore the acceptance and limitation of artificial intelligence use in cardiovascular medicine in France. By identifying key facilitators and barriers, this study aims to inform strategic initiatives for more effective and equitable artificial intelligence implementation in French-speaking healthcare systems.},

We herein introduce the EOQ World Tour game, which substantially improves understanding of inventory-related concepts and long-term knowledge retention compared with traditional methods. Generative AI is revolutionizing management education, by offering innovative methods for teaching and learning. The integration of AI into quantitative business disciplines through novel learning mechanisms provides significant benefits, including enhanced data analysis, improved decision-making models, and sophisticated simulations for hands-on experience. This study introduces the EOQ World Tour game, specifically designed to teach the Economic Order Quantity concept in Operations Management. The game addresses challenges in integrating Generative AI into mathematics in management education by combining human oversight and instructor control through three innovative features: (1) a Generative AI-based simulation, (2) a macropowered Excel worksheet for validating the calculations of an AI chatbot, and (3) a Google Sheets dashboard for centralizing team-generated AI data for postgame analysis. Our study included 41 students divided into experimental and control groups. Pretest results indicated no significant differences in baseline knowledge. However, the post-test results showed that the experimental group achieved a better understanding of inventory-related concepts and practical applications, along with higher engagement, excitement, confidence, and long-term knowledge retention.},

    abstract = {This study explores university students’ engagement with Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) tools for creative writing and graphic storytelling, drawing on Jacques Rancière's philosophy of intellectual equality and emancipation. Qualitative data analysis from a co-curricular creative writing programme, including reflections, surveys, and focus-group interviews, reveals emerging artificial intelligence literacies and students’ improvisational aptitudes for interpreting, subverting, and transforming notions of authorship. Students decentred authorial attribution through the pragmatic adoption of the technology as a creative catalyst, negotiated creative conventions by adopting non-conventional communication strategies, and reconceptualised creativity as distributed across human and non-human agents. Our approach of student-driven learning for autonomous exploration, sense-making, and criticality with GenAI indicates the potential for promoting conditions for students to exercise intellectual equality and emancipation. The findings contribute to the understanding of authorship and creativity; begin to contour emerging GenAI literacies and competencies; and suggest that creative collaborations with GenAI may be a promising way to foster emancipatory practices in the classroom, while nurturing creative and critical skills.},

Questions regarding how the use of AI has affected the core functions of the film industry's value chain (Creation, Production, Dissemination and Exhibition) have only been partially or inadequately explored. This paper intends to address this research gap by conducting a systematic literature review of 74 relevant articles based on the Webster & Watson methodology, to be followed by a conceptual analysis of AI-related themes in the film industry. Our findings reveal that artificial intelligence has long played a role in the film industry, and its influence has only grown with recent advancements in AI, having an impact across the film industry's value chain. We also highlight emerging ethical concerns, such as authorship, creative integrity, and labor displacement that accompany AI's expanding role. Whilst our work contributes to the body of research on AI in the film industry, we also identify potential avenues of research that allow room for future exploration.},

However, to the best of our knowledge, there is a very limited amount of work on this topic. Therefore, our study has two objectives. First, through human coding, we determine whether student essays submitted as homework were created by humans or software, and second, we examine these essays' sentiment and authorship, as well as factors determining the use of artificial intelligence in learning. Data collection was conducted in April and May 2024 across thirty classes from twenty Hungarian high schools. Our results show that 16 % of high school students (N = 548) wrote their text-based homework assignments using artificial intelligence, though neither age nor parents' average educational level determined the use of AI in learning. Although women have more positive attitudes toward using AI for learning purposes, they are less likely to use it to complete their homework assignments. Finally, we found that fears related to artificial intelligence are general and lack specificity. Our findings have three practical implications: 1) they highlight the need for targeted educational programs to develop ethical AI use, 2) they assist teachers in identifying AI-generated texts, and 3) they draw attention to gender differences in AI usage.},

Specifically, this convergent, mixed methods case study explores the impact of employing Generative AI (GenAI) tools and cyber-social teaching methods on the development of higher education students’ AI literacy. Three 8-week courses on advanced digital technologies for education in a graduate program in the College of Education at a mid-western US university served as the study sites. Data were based on 37 participants’ experiences with two different types of GenAI tools–a GenAI reviewer and GenAI image generator platforms. The application of the GenAI review tool relied on precision fine-tuning and transparency in AI-human interactions, while the AI image generation tools facilitated the participants’ reflection on their learning experiences and AI's role in education. Students’ interaction with both tools was designed to foster their learning regarding GenAI's strengths and limitations, and their responsible application in educational contexts. The findings revealed that the participants appeared to feel more comfortable using GenAI tools after their course experiences. The results also point to the students’ enhanced ability to understand and critically assess the value of AI applications in education.

While publications applying AI in allergy and immunology have increased, clinical implementation substantially lags behind other specialties. By mid-2024, over 1,000 FDA-approved AI-enabled medical devices existed, but none specifically addressed allergy and immunology. This gap partly reflects our field's limited reliance on imaging, which facilitated early AI breakthroughs in radiology and pathology. This narrative review examines recent AI developments, including Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI agents, evaluating their applicability to allergy and immunology practice. We analyze current and potential applications, emphasizing those demonstrating clinical value, while identifying implementation barriers amplified by allergic diseases' unique complexities, including data privacy concerns, bias, reliability constraints, and evolving regulatory frameworks. To bridge the persistent research-to-implementation gap, we propose a 6-point roadmap: (1) prioritize impactful applications, (2) define clinically relevant benchmarks, (3) enforce rigorous governance, (4) transition to operationalization, (5) promote clinical adoption through trustworthy AI, and (6) establish lifecycle management. This roadmap builds upon established implementation frameworks while incorporating critical field-specific considerations unique to allergy and immunology. Through this approach, we aim to provide a perspective for advancing AI in allergy and immunology from academic promise to tangible clinical benefit.},

    abstract = {Context:
Web accessibility ensures that individuals with disabilities can access, navigate, and interact with online content effectively. Despite the availability of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), significant barriers persist, largely due to the complexity of their implementation. Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly machine learning models, has emerged as a promising avenue to address these challenges, offering solutions for evaluation, correction, and content generation.
Objective:
This study aims to systematically review the intersection of web accessibility and AI by evaluating how AI-based methods enhance compliance with accessibility standards over the period 2019–2025, assessing their efficacy and alignment with WCAG principles.
Methods:
A systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted in three phases: planning, execution, and reporting. Research questions were formulated guiding the selection of search terms and strategies. A systematic search process was implemented, complemented by a snowballing technique to ensure comprehensive coverage of relevant studies. The quality of selected studies was rigorously assessed using predefined criteria, and data extraction was carried out following established best practices. The analysis combined narrative synthesis for qualitative insights and bibliometric techniques for quantitative evaluation.
Results:
From 277 studies, 31 were identified as relevant, highlighting AI’s primary contributions to generating alternative text for images, automating compliance assessments, providing correction suggestions, and designing alternative interfaces to enhance accessibility. Advances in large language models (LLMs) further demonstrate their potential for facilitating the creation of accessible content.
Conclusions:
AI presents significant potential to improve web accessibility by streamlining evaluation processes and supporting the creation of accessible content. However, further research is needed to address limitations such as inconsistent compliance and the lack of focus on non-visual disabilities. These findings underline the importance of leveraging AI to facilitate inclusive web design practices while ensuring adherence to accessibility standards.},

Although the supervised models now in use are competent, they frequently rely on annotated datasets and create challenges regarding uninterpretability and limited generalization ability.

During the generation of the output sequence, the model takes into account data from various segments of the input sequence by utilizing a modified abstractive cross-attention technique. Specifically, the Generative Artificial Intelligence assists in removing grammatical mistakes in summaries via the application of the Global Surrogate method, which ensures the clarity and fluency of the output summary. In addition, the encoder-decoder model enables the accurate summary generation process, vastly improving fluency and accuracy.

This Review examines key opportunities and challenges associated with AI applications along the neuro-oncological care trajectory. We highlight emerging trends in foundation models, biophysical modelling, synthetic data, and drug development and discuss regulatory, operational, and ethical hurdles across data, translation, and implementation gaps. Near-term clinical translation depends on scaling validated AI solutions for well defined clinical tasks. In contrast, more experimental AI solutions offer broader potential but require technical refinement and resolution of data and regulatory challenges. Addressing both general and neuro-oncology-specific issues is essential to unlock the full potential of AI and ensure its responsible, effective, and needs-based integration into neuro-oncological practice.},

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is capable of revolutionizing cancer therapy and advancing precision oncology via integrating genomics data and digitized health information. AI applications show promise in cancer prediction, prognosis, and treatment planning, particularly in radiomics, deep learning, and machine learning for early cancer diagnosis. However, widespread adoption requires comprehensive data and clinical validation. While AI has demonstrated advantages in treating common malignancies like lung and breast cancers, challenges remain in managing rare tumors due to limited datasets. AI's role in processing multi-omics data and supporting precision oncology decision-making is critical as genetic and health data become increasingly digitized.
Method
This review article presents current knowledge on AI and associated technologies, which are being utilized in the diagnosis and therapy of cancer. The applications of AI in radiomics, deep learning, and machine learning for cancer screening and treatment planning are examined. The study also explores the capabilities and limitations of predictive AI in diagnosis and prognosis, as well as generative AI, such as advanced chatbots, in patient and provider interactions.
Results
AI can improve the early diagnosis and treatment of high-incidence cancers like breast and lung cancer. However, its application in rare cancers is limited by insufficient data for training and validation. AI can effectively process large-scale multi-omics data from DNA and RNA sequencing, enhancing precision oncology. Predictive AI aids in risk assessment and prognosis, while generative AI tools improve patient-provider communication. Despite these advancements, further research and technological progress are needed to overcome existing challenges.
Conclusions
AI holds transformative potential for cancer therapy, particularly in precision oncology, early detection, and personalized treatment planning. However, challenges such as data limitations in rare cancers, the need for clinical validation, and regulatory considerations must be addressed. Future advancements in AI could significantly improve decision-support systems in oncology, ultimately enhancing patient care and quality of life. The review highlights both the opportunities and obstacles in integrating AI into cancer diagnostics and therapeutics, calling for continued research and regulatory oversight.},

    abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized medicine over the past several years. A generative adversarial network (GAN) is a deep learning framework that has become a powerful technique in medicine, particularly in ophthalmology for image analysis. In this paper we review the current ophthalmic literature involving GANs, and highlight key contributions in the field. We briefly touch on ChatGPT, another application of generative AI, and its potential in ophthalmology. We also explore the potential uses for GANs in ocular imaging, with a specific emphasis on 3 primary domains: image enhancement, disease identification, and generating of synthetic data. PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, Google Scholar were searched from inception to October 30, 2022, to identify applications of GAN in ophthalmology. A total of 40 papers were included in this review. We cover various applications of GANs in ophthalmic-related imaging including optical coherence tomography, orbital magnetic resonance imaging, fundus photography, and ultrasound; however, we also highlight several challenges that resulted in the generation of inaccurate and atypical results during certain iterations. Finally, we examine future directions and considerations for generative AI in ophthalmology.},

Despite the risks associated with generative AI (GenAI) chatbots, people increasingly use these technologies, which may seem contradictory. This study identified and explored factors and risks related to trust, perceived values, satisfaction, and sustainable use of GenAI chatbots. Relying on IS theories to build a stimulus-organism-response model, the authors tested a model using PLS-SEM with data from 393 ChatGPT users. The results show that user competence and autonomy dramatically increase a user's trust in ChatGPT, and trust improves hedonic value (HV), utilitarian value (UV), value-in-use, perceived task-technology fit (TTF), information accuracy, knowledge acquisition, perceived informativeness, and user satisfaction. In addition to trust, user satisfaction depends on HV, UV, and TTF. The sustainability use of ChatGPT depends on HV and satisfaction. However, perceived privacy concerns, perceived privacy risks, and privacy awareness do not affect consumer trust. There is a complete mediation between trust and sustainability, as well as HV and sustainability.},

    abstract = {Objective
We developed a novel slit-lamp photography (SLP) generative adversarial network (GAN) model using limited data to supplement and improve the performance of an artificial intelligence (AI)–based microbial keratitis (MK) screening model.
Design
Cross-sectional study.
Subjects
Slit-lamp photographs of 67 healthy and 36 MK eyes were prospectively and retrospectively collected at a tertiary care ophthalmology clinic at a large academic institution.
Methods
We trained the GAN model StyleGAN2-ADA on healthy and MK SLPs to generate synthetic images. To assess synthetic image quality, we performed a visual Turing test. Three cornea fellows tested their ability to identify 20 images each of (1) real healthy, (2) real diseased, (3) synthetic healthy, and (4) synthetic diseased. We also used Kernel Inception Distance (KID) to quantitatively measure realism and variation of synthetic images. Using the same dataset used to train the GAN model, we trained 2 DenseNet121 AI models to grade SLP images as healthy or MK with (1) only real images and (2) real supplemented with GAN-generated images.
Main Outcome Measures
Classification performance of MK screening models trained with only real images compared to a model trained with both limited real and supplemented synthetic GAN images.
Results
For the visual Turing test, the fellows on average rated synthetic images as good quality (83.3% ± 12.0% of images), and synthetic and real images were found to depict pertinent anatomy and pathology for accurate classification (96.3% ± 2.19% of images). These experts could distinguish between real and synthetic images (accuracy: 92.5% ± 9.01%). Analysis of KID score for synthetic images indicated realism and variation. The MK screening model trained on both limited real and supplemented synthetic data (area under the receiver–operator characteristic curve: 0.93, bootstrapping 95% CI: 0.77–1.0) outperformed the model trained with only real data (area under the receiver–operator characteristic curve: 0.76, 95% CI: 0.50–1.0), with an improvement of 0.17 (95% CI: 0–0.4; 2-tailed t test P = 0.076).
Conclusions
Artificial intelligence–based MK classification may be improved by supplementation of limited real training data with synthetic data generated by GANs.

However, their vast compositional space and complex inter-element interactions pose significant challenges for traditional development methods. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) with high-throughput techniques has emerged as a powerful solution, revolutionizing the discovery and optimization of HEMs. This review highlights the synergistic paradigm of AI and high-throughput methods in HEMs research. High-throughput experimental approaches enable rapid screening of multiple compositions, while complementary computational methods provide theoretical insights and accelerate predictions of material properties. Machine learning models, ranging from supervised learning to unsupervised learning offer robust tools for predicting material properties, optimizing compositions, and discovering new materials. Generative models and inverse design approaches further enable the creation of novel HEMs with desired properties. The multi - objective optimization framework provides an effective means to find the best balance among multiple performance indicators. Large language models process and integrate massive amounts of data and extract key information, providing data-driven insights for the discovery of complex materials. The integration of these techniques into a closed-loop development system enables continuous feedback between experimental data, computational predictions, and machine learning models, thereby accelerating the discovery and optimization of HEMs, which not only streamlines the exploration of vast compositional spaces but also provides multi-scale insights into material behavior. As AI continues to evolve and integrate with emerging technologies, the future of HEM research holds great promise for sustainable development and accelerate their translation from the laboratory to practical applications.},

Despite a series of related studies and reviews around GAI, existing reviews predominantly focus on macro-level discussions covering overall development trends, core issues, opportunities and risks. There has been a lack of systematic reviews from a meso-level perspective examining the application of GAI in classroom teaching within higher education. This study employs a systematic literature review method, examining 139 articles from Web of Science, EBSCO, and Scopus databases. Findings include: (1)In terms of disciplines and types of GAI applications, engineering, health and medicine, and language are the most popular, while humanities, social sciences, basic sciences, mathematics, sports sciences, and interdisciplinary fields have fewer applications. Based on Strobel's classification of GAI(2024), it is found that Generators, Reimaginators, and Assistants are the most widely applied types of GAI. In contrast, Synthesizers and Enablers are less commonly utilized. Regarding the adoption trends across disciplines, engineering and language have a diverse range of GAI product types applied, whereas health and medicine has fewer types of GAI products in use. Due to smaller sample sizes, the analysis of GAI product types in the remaining six disciplines is also relatively limited. (2)In terms of the application of GAI across different disciplines, a small portion of GAI applications reflect distinctive disciplinary characteristics. Regarding the roles mapped out by the application of GAI, based on Xu and Ouyang's classification(2022), instructors or students predominantly perceive GAI as “New Subject” or “Direct Mediator", with less emphasis on the role of “Supplement Assistant”. Regarding the integration into the classroom, as assessed through the SAMR framework, most GAI applications are in the Augmentation level. There are also some in the Substitution and Modification levels, while applications in the Redefinition level are relatively rare. (3)In terms of the selection of instructional strategies under GAI applications, there are 18 types of strategies across four orientations, primarily emphasizing constructive and reflective orientations. Strategies focusing on didactic and authentic orientiations are less frequently utilized. Regarding the roles GAI plays as reflected in instructional strategies, it predominantly assumes roles as “New Subject” and “Direct Mediator", with the role of “Supplementary Assistant” yet to be explored. Finally, this study evaluated the instructional application research of GAI from three dimensions: GAI product type and applied discipline, discipline-specific application and integration level, instructional strategies and GAI role, and put forward relevant research suggestions.},

Without clarifying the factor structures and dimensionality of GenAI literacy, EFL teachers face challenges in effectively leveraging GenAI in their teaching. To address this gap, our study aimed to develop and validate a GenAI literacy scale for the Chinese EFL context, involving 603 EFL teachers. Specifically, a tentative scale comprising 38 five-point Likert items was administered to participants. Through Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), the final scale was refined, evincing 32 items categorized into five dimensions: “GenAI Knowledge”, “GenAI Use”, “GenAI Evaluation”, “GenAI Design”, and “GenAI Ethics”. Moreover, statistical analysis also verified the scale's convergent validity and reliability in measuring the construct of GenAI literacy. We anticipate that this EFL teachers' GenAI literacy scale will guide teachers and teacher educators in enhancing GenAI capabilities for professional growth. It can also inspire them to innovate teaching with AI tools, thereby offering them fresh insights into GenAI literacy and its sub-components in the rapidly evolving landscape of AI-integrated EFL education.},

Effective use reflects the users’ utilization of generative conversational AI to achieve their goals, which has not been previously studied. Drawing on the media naturalness theory, we examined how generative conversational AI’s content and style naturalness affect effective use. A two-wave survey was conducted to collect data from 565 users of generative conversational AI. Two techniques were used in this study. Initially, partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was applied to determine the variables that significantly affected the mechanisms (i.e., cognitive effort and communication ambiguity) and effective use. Secondly, an artificial neural network model was used to evaluate the relative importance of the significant predictors of mechanisms and effective use identified from the PLS-SEM analysis. The results revealed that the naturalness of content and style differed in their effects on cognitive effort and communication ambiguity. Additionally, cognitive effort and communication ambiguity negatively affected effective use. This study advances the literature on effective use by uncovering the psychological mechanisms underlying effective use and their antecedents. In addition, this study offers insights into the design of generative conversational AI.},

    abstract = {Digital pathology has transformed the traditional pathology practice of analyzing tissue under a microscope into a computer vision workflow. Whole-slide imaging allows pathologists to view and analyze microscopic images on a computer monitor, enabling computational pathology. By leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), computational pathology has emerged as a promising field in recent years. Recently, task-specific AI/ML (eg, convolutional neural networks) has risen to the forefront, achieving above-human performance in many image-processing and computer vision tasks. The performance of task-specific AI/ML models depends on the availability of many annotated training datasets, which presents a rate-limiting factor for AI/ML development in pathology. Task-specific AI/ML models cannot benefit from multimodal data and lack generalization, eg, the AI models often struggle to generalize to new datasets or unseen variations in image acquisition, staining techniques, or tissue types. The 2020s are witnessing the rise of foundation models and generative AI. A foundation model is a large AI model trained using sizable data, which is later adapted (or fine-tuned) to perform different tasks using a modest amount of task-specific annotated data. These AI models provide in-context learning, can self-correct mistakes, and promptly adjust to user feedback. In this review, we provide a brief overview of recent advances in computational pathology enabled by task-specific AI, their challenges and limitations, and then introduce various foundation models. We propose to create a pathology-specific generative AI based on multimodal foundation models and present its potentially transformative role in digital pathology. We describe different use cases, delineating how it could serve as an expert companion of pathologists and help them efficiently and objectively perform routine laboratory tasks, including quantifying image analysis, generating pathology reports, diagnosis, and prognosis. We also outline the potential role that foundation models and generative AI can play in standardizing the pathology laboratory workflow, education, and training.},

Therefore, a sleep study that includes sleep patterns and disorders is crucial to enhancing our knowledge about individual health status. The findings on sleep stages and sleep disorders relied on Polysomnography and self-report measures, and then the study went through clinical assessments by expert physicians. Artificial Intelligence has made the evaluation process of sleep stages and sleep disorders classification more efficient. Many studies have focused on analyzing various datasets using advanced techniques and algorithms to improve computational ease and accuracy. This review aims to comprehensively analyze recent literature on different approaches and outcomes in sleep studies, specifically on ‘sleep stages classification’ and ‘sleep disorder detection’ using Artificial Intelligence. Initially, 185 articles were selected from top journals, and eventually, 81 of them were reviewed in detail, covering the period from 2016 to 2023. Brain waves are the most commonly used body signals for studying sleep patterns and disorders. Almost 36 % of the research exclusively used brain activity signals, and 80 % combined them with other body parameters in sleep staging. The Neural Network algorithms are the most popular, having 47 % of the total usage. At the same time, Long Short-Term Memory, Ensemble Learning, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest accounted for 15 %, 12 %, 7 %, and 6 % of usage, respectively. For evaluating AI model performance, accuracy or precision is used in 86.42 % of cases, followed by an F1 score of 46.91 %, Kappa of 39.51 %, Specificity of 30.86 %, Sensitivity of 29.63 %, along with other metrics.

To this end, we propose the Edge Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (EdgeAIGC) framework, which can effectively solve the problems brought by cloud computing by implementing in-situ processing of services close to the data source through edge computing. However, AIGC models usually have a large parameter scale and complex computing requirements, which poses a huge challenge to the storage and computing resources of edge devices. This paper focuses on the edge intelligence model caching and resource allocation problems in the EdgeAIGC framework, aiming to improve the cache hit rate and resource utilization of edge devices for models by optimizing the model caching strategy and resource allocation scheme, and realize in-situ AIGC service processing. With the optimization objectives of minimizing service request response time and execution cost in resource-constrained environments, we employ the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm for optimization. Experimental results show that, compared with other methods, our model caching and resource allocation strategies can effectively improve the cache hit rate by at least 41.06% and reduce the response cost.},

Such a prediction can help educators to design effective learning activities by providing educational experiences that cater to students' different personality traits for specific learning objectives in the GenAI context. This study explored how variations in five representative personality traits affect students’ SRL performance when learning with ChatGPT. It used an explanatory approach based on structural equation modelling with a path analysis design. Four hundred and nine university students participated in the study and finished a self-reported questionnaire with validated items that are driven by previous studies. The results revealed that the personality traits of openness, extraversion, and agreeableness were significant predictors of all three stages of SRL; conscientiousness was a significant predictor of the forethought and self-reflection stages; and neuroticism failed to predict any of the three stages of SRL. These results may be attributable to the subjective nature of personality traits and the cognitive characteristics of SRL skills. The findings enrich the literature on SRL by introducing personality traits and GenAI as innovative perspectives and suggesting corresponding strategies for supporting different stages of SRL.},

This symposium paper seeks to summarize current recommendations on the use of GenAI tools in scientific article preparation, and to provide speculations about the future challenges and opportunities of GenAI use in scientific publishing. Due to the dynamic nature of these tools and the rapid advancement of their sophistication, the most important recommendation is that ongoing engagement and discussion within the scientific community about these issues is critical. When using GenAI tools in scientific article preparation, humans are ultimately accountable and responsible for products produced. Given that accountability, an expert panel convened by the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine recently proposed principles of GenAI use in science communication, including (1) transparent disclosure and attribution; (2) verification of AI-generated content and analyses; (3) documentation of artificial intelligence (AI)-generated data; (4) a focus on ethics and equity; and (5) continuous monitoring, oversight, and public engagement. In addition to the importance of human accountability, many publishers have established consistent policies suggesting that GenAI tools should not be used for peer reviewing, figure generation or manipulation, or assigned authorship on scientific articles. Along with the potential ethical challenges associated with GenAI use in scientific publishing, there are numerous potential benefits. Herein we summarize example conversations demonstrating the capacity of GenAI tools to support the article preparation process, and an example standard operating procedure for human-AI interaction in article preparation.

    abstract = {Background
Use of artificial intelligence to generate personal statements for residency is currently not permitted but is difficult to monitor. This study sought to evaluate the ability of surgical residency application reviewers to identify artificial intelligence–generated personal statements and to understand perceptions of this practice.
Methods
Three personal statements were generated using ChatGPT, and 3 were written by medical students who previously matched into surgery residency. Blinded participants at a single institution were instructed to read all personal statements and identify which were generated by artificial intelligence; they then completed a survey exploring their opinions regarding artificial intelligence use.
Results
Of the 30 participants, 50% were faculty (n = 15) and 50% were residents (n = 15). Overall, experience ranged from 0 to 20 years (median, 2 years; interquartile range, 1–6.25 years). Artificial intelligence–derived personal statements were identified correctly only 59% of the time, with 3 (10%) participants identifying all the artificial intelligence–derived personal statements correctly. Artificial intelligence–generated personal statements were labeled as the best 60% of the time and the worst 43.3% of the time. When asked whether artificial intelligence use should be allowed in personal statements writing, 66.7% (n = 20) said no and 30% (n = 9) said yes. When asked if the use of artificial intelligence would impact their opinion of an applicant, 80% (n = 24) said yes, and 20% (n = 6) said no. When survey questions and ability to identify artificial intelligence–generated personal statements were evaluated by faculty/resident status and experience, no differences were noted (P > .05).
Conclusion
This study shows that surgical faculty and residents cannot reliably identify artificial intelligence–generated personal statements and that concerns exist regarding the impact of artificial intelligence on the application process.},

Health care–associated infection (HAI) surveillance is vital for safety in health care settings. It helps identify infection risk factors, enhancing patient safety and quality improvement. However, HAI surveillance is complex, demanding specialized knowledge and resources. This study investigates the use of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly generative large language models, to improve HAI surveillance.
Methods
We assessed 2 AI agents, OpenAI's chatGPT plus (GPT-4) and a Mixtral 8×7b-based local model, for their ability to identify Central Line-Associated Bloodstream Infection (CLABSI) and Catheter-Associated Urinary Tract Infection (CAUTI) from 6 National Health Care Safety Network training scenarios. The complexity of these scenarios was analyzed, and responses were matched against expert opinions.
Results
Both AI models accurately identified CLABSI and CAUTI in all scenarios when given clear prompts. Challenges appeared with ambiguous prompts including Arabic numeral dates, abbreviations, and special characters, causing occasional inaccuracies in repeated tests.
Discussion
The study demonstrates AI's potential in accurately identifying HAIs like CLABSI and CAUTI. Clear, specific prompts are crucial for reliable AI responses, highlighting the need for human oversight in AI-assisted HAI surveillance.
Conclusions
AI shows promise in enhancing HAI surveillance, potentially streamlining tasks, and freeing health care staff for patient-focused activities. Effective AI use requires user education and ongoing AI model refinement.},

This study helps researchers select suitable tools by focusing on phrase-based dictionary methods. We empirically evaluate four software packages—LIWC, DICTION, CAT Scanner, and a custom Python tool—using the complex construct of value-based management as a test case. The analysis shows that software from the same methodological family produces highly consistent results, while popular but mismatched tools yield significant errors such as miscounted phrases. Based on this, we develop a structured selection guideline that links construct features with software capabilities. The framework enhances construct validity, supports methodological transparency, and is applicable across disciplines. Finally, we position the approach as a bridge to AI-enabled textual analysis, including prompt-based workflows, reinforcing the continued need for theory-grounded construct design.},

More importantly, it analyses the potentially disruptive impact of this ascendant technology on higher education and the global workplace. The findings of this paper indicate that students pursuing higher education tend to perceive GAI favourably, as it frees them from the toil of rote-learning. However, the view is rather mixed in the case of educators, who are still coming to grips with this seemingly disruptive technology. In the case of the global labour market, GAI has the potential to decimate legions of white-collar jobs once it eliminates inherent issues of biases, security and misinformation. Despite the media’s constant labelling of GAI as a disruptive technology that has suddenly burst onto the technological scene, it is evidenced in this paper that the technology has taken nearly eight decades to reach today’s level of technological advancement. Further, it is far from reaching its full potential, as it is still incorporating advances in pattern recognition, planning and problem solving, and quantum computing technologies. This study also warns of concentrating the power of this game-changing technology in the hands of a few major corporate titans.},

This systematic review study investigates how to design SRL activities using GenAI. We examined 73 articles published over the past five years, drawn from four databases: Web of Science, ProQuest, ERIC, and Scopus. This study has three major empirical findings. First, six pedagogical affordances from GenAI across the three phases of SRL—forethought, Performance, and self-reflection—are (i) creating personalized learning objectives; (ii) searching for, analyzing, and integrating resources; (iii) monitoring and evaluating progress; (iv) recommending learning strategies; (v) recording progress and providing feedback; and (vi) generating new ideas and examples. Second, popular student learning activities using GenAI in each phase are information searching in the forethought; strategies for problem-solving in the performance, and obtaining feedback and conducting self-assessments in the self-reflection. Third, two major dimensions influencing student engagement in SRL using GenAI are individual and environmental. Finally, we visualize how the three empirical findings relate to each other.

    abstract = {Introduction
The emergence and application of generative artificial intelligence/large language models (hereafter GenAI LLMs) have the potential for significant impact on the healthcare industry. However, there is currently a lack of systematic research on GenAI LLMs in healthcare based on reliable data. This article aims to conduct an exploratory study of the application of GenAI LLMs (i.e., ChatGPT) in healthcare from the perspective of digital media (i.e., online news), including the application scenarios, potential opportunities, and challenges.
Methods
This research used thematic qualitative text analysis in five steps: firstly, developing main topical categories based on relevant articles; secondly, encoding the search keywords using these categories; thirdly, conducting searches for news articles via Google ; fourthly, encoding the sub-categories using the elaborate category system; and finally, conducting category-based analysis and presenting the results. Natural language processing techniques, including the TermRaider and AntConc tool, were applied in the aforementioned steps to assist in text qualitative analysis. Additionally, this study built a framework, using for analyzing the above three topics, from the perspective of five different stakeholders, including healthcare demanders and providers.
Results
This study summarizes 26 applications (e.g., provide medical advice, provide diagnosis and triage recommendations, provide mental health support, etc.), 21 opportunities (e.g., make healthcare more accessible, reduce healthcare costs, improve patients care, etc.), and 17 challenges (e.g., generate inaccurate/misleading/wrong answers, raise privacy concerns, lack of transparency, etc.), and analyzes the reasons for the formation of these key items and the links between the three research topics.
Conclusions
The application of GenAI LLMs in healthcare is primarily focused on transforming the way healthcare demanders access medical services (i.e., making it more intelligent, refined, and humane) and optimizing the processes through which healthcare providers offer medical services (i.e., simplifying, ensuring timeliness, and reducing errors). As the application becomes more widespread and deepens, GenAI LLMs is expected to have a revolutionary impact on traditional healthcare service models, but it also inevitably raises ethical and security concerns. Furthermore, GenAI LLMs applied in healthcare is still in the initial stage, which can be accelerated from a specific healthcare field (e.g., mental health) or a specific mechanism (e.g., GenAI LLMs’ economic benefits allocation mechanism applied to healthcare) with empirical or clinical research.},

    abstract = {Background
Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have led to the creation of large language models (LLMs), such as Chat Generative Pretrained Transformer (ChatGPT) and Bard, that analyze online resources to synthesize responses to user queries. Despite their popularity, the accuracy of LLM responses to medical questions remains unknown. This study aimed to compare the responses of ChatGPT and Bard regarding treatments for hip and knee osteoarthritis with the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) recommendations.
Methods
Both ChatGPT (Open AI) and Bard (Google) were queried regarding 20 treatments (10 for hip and 10 for knee osteoarthritis) from the AAOS CPGs. Responses were classified by 2 reviewers as being in “Concordance,” “Discordance,” or “No Concordance” with AAOS CPGs. A Cohen’s Kappa coefficient was used to assess inter-rater reliability, and Chi-squared analyses were used to compare responses between LLMs.
Results
Overall, ChatGPT and Bard provided responses that were concordant with the AAOS CPGs for 16 (80%) and 12 (60%) treatments, respectively. Notably, ChatGPT and Bard encouraged the use of non-recommended treatments in 30% and 60% of queries, respectively. There were no differences in performance when evaluating by joint or by recommended versus non-recommended treatments. Studies were referenced in 6 (30%) of the Bard responses and none (0%) of the ChatGPT responses. Of the 6 Bard responses, studies could only be identified for 1 (16.7%). Of the remaining, 2 (33.3%) responses cited studies in journals that did not exist, 2 (33.3%) cited studies that could not be found with the information given, and 1 (16.7%) provided links to unrelated studies.
Conclusions
Both ChatGPT and Bard do not consistently provide responses that align with the AAOS CPGs. Consequently, physicians and patients should temper expectations on the guidance AI platforms can currently provide.},

Pesticides play a pivotal role in ensuring food security, and the development of green pesticides is an inevitable trend in global agricultural progress. Although deep learning-based generative models have revolutionized de novo drug design in pharmaceutical research, their application in pesticide research and development remains unexplored.
Objectives
This study aims to pioneer the application of generative artificial intelligence to pesticide design by proposing a reinforcement learning-based framework for obtaining pesticide-like molecules with high binding affinity.
Methods
This framework comprises two key components: PestiGen-G, which systematically explores the pesticide-like chemical space using a character-based generative model coupled with the REINFORCE algorithm; and PestiGen-S, which combines a fragment-based generative model with the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm to generate molecules that stably bind to the specific target protein.
Results
Experimental results show that the molecules generated by PestiGen have superior pesticide-likeness and binding affinity compared to those generated by existing methods. In addition, we employ an active learning strategy to reduce the false-positive rate of the generated molecules. Finally, through collaboration with domain experts, we successfully designed a novel 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase inhibitor (YH23768) with favorable enzyme inhibition and herbicidal potency.
Conclusion
This proof-of-concept study highlights the utility of PestiGen as a valuable tool for pesticide design. The web server based on the model is freely available at https://dpai.ccnu.edu.cn/PestiGen/.},

Scientific research has revealed only a minuscule fraction of the enzymes that evolution has generated to power life’s essential chemical reactions—and an even tinier fraction of the vast universe of possible enzymes. Beyond the enzymes already annotated lie an astronomical number of biocatalysts that could enable sustainable chemical production, degrade toxic pollutants, and advance disease diagnosis and treatment. For the past few decades, directed evolution has been a powerful strategy for reshaping enzymes to access new chemical transformations: by harnessing nature’s existing diversity as a starting point and taking inspiration from nature’s most powerful design process, evolution, to modify enzymes incrementally. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) methods have started revolutionizing how we understand and compose the language of life. In this perspective, we discuss a vision for AI-driven enzyme discovery to unveil a world of enzymes that transcends biological evolution and perhaps offers a route to genetically encoding almost any chemistry.},

    abstract = {Background
The Food and Drug Administration mandates patient labeling materials like the Medication Guide (MG) and Instructions for Use (IFU) to support appropriate medication use. However, challenges such as low health literacy and difficulties navigating these materials may lead to incorrect medication usage, resulting in therapy failure or adverse outcomes. The rise of generative AI, presents an opportunity to provide scalable, personalized patient education through image recognition and text generation.
Objective
This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy and safety of medication instructions generated by ChatGPT based on user-provided drug images, compared to the manufacturer's standard instructions.
Methods
Images of 12 medications requiring multiple steps for administration were uploaded to ChatGPT's image recognition function. ChatGPT's responses were compared to the official IFU and MG using text classifiers, Count Vectorization (CountVec), and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF). The clinical accuracy was further evaluated by independent pharmacists to determine if ChatGPT responses were valid for patient instruction.
Results
ChatGPT correctly identified all medications and generated patient instructions. CountVec outperformed TF-IDF in text similarity analysis, with an average similarity score of 76%. However, clinical evaluation revealed significant gaps in the instructions, particularly for complex administration routes, where ChatGPT's guidance lacked essential details, leading to lower clinical accuracy scores.
Conclusion
While ChatGPT shows promise in generating patient-friendly medication instructions, its effectiveness varies based on the complexity of the medication. The findings underscore the need for further refinement and clinical oversight to ensure the safety and accuracy of AI-generated medical guidance, particularly for medications with complex administration processes.},

This study contributes to identifying key components of this literacy through examining accepted GenAI uses in research practices. Based on a systematically sampled collection of 170 high-impact journals in applied linguistics, we investigated the scope and nature of GenAI use guidelines provided by 76 journals intended to guide authors. A checklist including four items regarding general statements and 17 items regarding three categories of specific aspects that GenAI guidelines target (authorship, uses, and human responsibility) was identified. Our findings reveal that (1) less than half of the journals provided GenAI use guidelines to guide authors, (2) the number of specific aspects varied across journals, with most falling short of comprehensive coverage, and (3) disagreements were observed about whether AI can be cited and used for manuscript drafting, idea generating, image generating, data generation, data collection, and data analysis and interpretation. Additionally, journals varied in their guidance on how to disclose GenAI uses. We propose recommendations for journals in improving their AI guidelines.

Traditionally, obtaining such materials has relied on trial and error, a process that is time-consuming, resource-intensive and laborious. In this study, an intelligent predictive framework using a generative artificial intelligence model is presented, which predicts the gas sensitivity of target materials with remarkable speed and accuracy. To validate the proposed framework, a material database is constructed using ZnO doped with eight different metal atoms, which serves as representative materials. Subsequently, 25 physical parameters, including crystal structure and electronic structure, are calculated using first-principles calculations. Eight intelligent learning models are then trained to predict sensitivity, with the Extremely Randomized Trees model performing the best, achieving a mean square error of 0.02. By combining feature engineering with generative artificial intelligence models, a novel model based on intrinsic atomic features (radius, electronegativity, first ionization energy) is developed, which enables the prediction of CO gas sensitivity in doped ZnO using the generated 12 key parameters, without any parameters from first principle calculation, thus significantly reducing the time and cost associated with discovering gas-sensitive properties. This predictive framework can be easily extended to other materials, facilitating the functional development of materials.},

This research presents a multi-phase study to address the issue of bridging the knowledge gap in AI by conducting co-creation with innovation champions, illustrated by a case of Generative AI innovation in a K-12 school. Using action design research, we engaged experienced teachers who are experts in pedagogical innovation to co-create a generative AI-enhanced platform at a leading K-12 education institution known for its pedagogical innovation in Australia. The findings reveal that champions enhance their knowledge through their subject-matter expertise, organizational knowledge, and AI knowledge gained through external exposure and experience. The study also highlights the key elements that facilitate a cross-domain knowledge exchange platform, enabling champions to be exposed to and experience AI technological learning, leading to shifts in their understanding and perception of AI. The initially unaware and sceptical champions become more aware and capable of articulating more technical AI knowledge rooted in a shared value.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly applied in medicine, with growing interest in its potential to improve outcomes in cardiac arrest (CA). However, the scope and characteristics of current AI applications in resuscitation remain unclear.
Methods
This scoping review aims to map the existing literature on AI applications in CA and resuscitation and identify research gaps for further investigation. PRISMA-ScR framework and ILCOR guidelines were followed. A systematic literature search across PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane identified AI applications in resuscitation. Articles were screened and classified by AI methodology, study design, outcomes, and implementation settings. AI-assisted data extraction was manually validated for accuracy.
Results
Out of 4046 records, 197 studies met inclusion criteria. Most were retrospective (90%), with only 16 prospective studies and 2 randomised controlled trials. AI was predominantly applied in prediction of CA, rhythm classification, and post-resuscitation outcome prognostication. Machine learning was the most commonly used method (50% of studies), followed by deep learning and, less frequently, natural language processing. Reported performance was generally high, with AUROC values often exceeding 0.85; however, external validation was rare and real-world implementation limited.
Conclusions
While AI applications in resuscitation demonstrate encouraging performance in prediction and decision support tasks, clear evidence of improved patient outcomes or routine clinical use remains limited. Future research should focus on prospective validation, equity in data sources, explainability, and seamless integration of AI tools into clinical workflows.},

Although early successes in single-gene pharmacogenetics reported clear clinical benefits, many drug response phenotypes are governed by intricate networks of genomic variants, epigenetic modifications, and metabolic pathways. Multi-omics approaches address this complexity by capturing genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic data layers, offering a comprehensive view of patient-specific biology. Advanced AI models, including deep neural networks, graph neural networks, and representation learning techniques, further enhance this landscape by detecting hidden patterns, filling gaps in incomplete data sets, and enabling in silico simulations of treatment responses. Such capabilities not only improve predictive accuracy but also deepen mechanistic insights, revealing how gene–gene and gene–environment interactions shape therapeutic outcomes. At the same time, real-world data from diverse patient populations is broadening the evidence base, underscoring the importance of inclusive datasets and population-specific algorithms to reduce health disparities.

    abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (AI), particularly large language models (LLMs), has emerged as a transformative technology across all medical specialties, including musculoskeletal (MSK) oncology. These models, such as ChatGPT and others, can process natural language, synthesize vast amounts of information, and generate contextually relevant outputs that resemble human communication. In orthopedic oncology, LLMs show promise in facilitating literature reviews, enhancing patient education, and supporting clinical decision-making by analyzing multidimensional data while providing improved logic-based reasoning. Additionally, they can assist in radiological and pathological workflows by interpreting imaging reports and drafting diagnostic summaries, thereby increasing efficiency and accuracy. In the near future, they are expected to aid in real-time patient follow-up and counseling, information transfer, efficient diagnostics, and even continuous surgical education and assistance. Despite their potential, challenges such as the risk of inaccuracies and biases, as well as the necessity for continuous supervision, warrant a cautious and responsible integration into clinical practice. This narrative review examines the current applications of LLMs in MSK oncology, their limitations, and their future potential in shaping precision medicine and equitable healthcare delivery.},

    abstract = {Background
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder posing challenges to patients, caregivers, and society. Accessible and accurate information is crucial for effective AD management.
Objective
This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy, comprehensibility, clarity, and usefulness of the Generative Pretrained Transformer’s (GPT) answers concerning the management and caregiving of patients with AD.
Methods
In total, 14 questions related to the prevention, treatment, and care of AD were identified and posed to GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 in Chinese and English, respectively, and 4 respondent neurologists were asked to answer them. We generated 8 sets of responses (total 112) and randomly coded them in answer sheets. Next, 5 evaluator neurologists and 5 family members of patients were asked to rate the 112 responses using separate 5-point Likert scales. We evaluated the quality of the responses using a set of 8 questions rated on a 5-point Likert scale. To gauge comprehensibility and participant satisfaction, we included 3 questions dedicated to each aspect within the same set of 8 questions.
Results
As of April 10, 2023, the 5 evaluator neurologists and 5 family members of patients with AD rated the 112 responses: GPT-3.5: n=28, 25%, responses; GPT-4: n=28, 25%, responses; respondent neurologists: 56 (50%) responses. The top 5 (4.5%) responses rated by evaluator neurologists had 4 (80%) GPT (GPT-3.5+GPT-4) responses and 1 (20%) respondent neurologist’s response. For the top 5 (4.5%) responses rated by patients’ family members, all but the third response were GPT responses. Based on the evaluation by neurologists, the neurologist-generated responses achieved a mean score of 3.9 (SD 0.7), while the GPT-generated responses scored significantly higher (mean 4.4, SD 0.6; P<.001). Language and model analyses revealed no significant differences in response quality between the GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models (GPT-3.5: mean 4.3, SD 0.7; GPT-4: mean 4.4, SD 0.5; P=.51). However, English responses outperformed Chinese responses in terms of comprehensibility (Chinese responses: mean 4.1, SD 0.7; English responses: mean 4.6, SD 0.5; P=.005) and participant satisfaction (Chinese responses: mean 4.2, SD 0.8; English responses: mean 4.5, SD 0.5; P=.04). According to the evaluator neurologists’ review, Chinese responses had a mean score of 4.4 (SD 0.6), whereas English responses had a mean score of 4.5 (SD 0.5; P=.002). As for the family members of patients with AD, no significant differences were observed between GPT and neurologists, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, or Chinese and English responses.
Conclusions
GPT can provide patient education materials on AD for patients, their families and caregivers, nurses, and neurologists. This capability can contribute to the effective health care management of patients with AD, leading to enhanced patient outcomes.},

Artificial intelligence (AI) offers promises for improving TED diagnosis and treatment; however, no systematic review has yet characterized the research landscape, key challenges, and future directions. We followed PRISMA guidelines to search multiple databases until January, 2025, for studies applying AI to computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging, and nuclear, facial or retinal imaging in TED patients. Using the APPRAISE-AI tool, we assessed study quality and included 41 studies covering various AI applications. Sample sizes ranged from 33 to 2288 participants, predominantly East Asian. CT and facial imaging were the most common modalities, reported in 16 and 13 articles, respectively. Studies addressed clinical tasks—diagnosis, activity assessment, severity classification, and treatment prediction—and technical tasks—classification, segmentation, and image generation—with classification being the most frequent. Researchers primarily employed deep-learning models, such as residual network (ResNet) and Visual Geometry Group (VGG). Overall, the majority of the studies were of moderate quality. Image-based AI shows strong potential to improve diagnostic accuracy and guide personalized treatment strategies in TED. Future research should prioritize robust study designs, the creation of public datasets, multimodal imaging integration, and interdisciplinary collaboration to accelerate clinical translation.},

    abstract = {With the rapid development of renewable energy and electric vehicles, batteries, as the core components of electrochemical energy storage systems, have become a global focus in both scientific research and industrial sectors due to their critical impact on system efficiency and safety. However, the complex multi-physics reactions within batteries make traditional mathematical models inadequate for comprehensively revealing their mechanisms. The key to solving this problem lies in introducing data-driven approaches, which have laid a solid foundation for battery research and development through extensive accumulation of experimental data and extraction of effective information. Generative artificial intelligence (GAI), leveraging its powerful latent pattern learning and data generation capabilities, has already found widespread applications in protein structure prediction, material inverse design, and data augmentation, demonstrating its broad application prospects. Applying GAI to battery research workflows with diverse battery data resources could provide innovative solutions to challenges in battery research. In this perspective, we introduce the core principles and latest advancements of generative models (GMs), including Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE), and Diffusion Model (DM), which can learn the latent distribution of the input samples to generate new data by sampling from it. Applications of GAI in battery research are then reviewed. For battery materials design, by learning material compositions, structures, and properties, GM can generate novel candidate materials with desired properties through conditional constraints, significantly extending the chemical space to be explored. For electrode microstructure characterization, GM can serve as a bridge for interconversion and integration of different image data, enhance the quality of microscopic characterization, and generate realistic synthetic data. For battery state estimation, GM can perform data augmentation and feature extraction on battery datasets, which benefits the model performance for battery state estimation. Lastly, we discuss the challenges and future development directions in terms of data governance and model design, including data quality and diversity, data standardization and sharing, usability of synthetic data, interpretability of GM, and foundational models for battery research. For the innovation and advancement of battery technology, this perspective offers theoretical references and practical guidelines for implementing GAI as an effective tool in battery research workflows by discussing its status and prospects in this field.},

To assess educational alignment where these changes, the review follows a two-step approach: first, it draws on academic and policy literature to identify emerging technologies and the associated legal competencies needed to navigate their regulatory impact; second, it then evaluates the extent to which China’s maritime law curricula address these professional requirements. As this review aims to highlight, much scholarly and technical attention has been given to the operational and environmental dimensions of maritime innovation, there remains a professional skills gap – a disconnect between the competences now demanded by industry and those currently taught in legal education. Through comparative curriculum analysis, the paper highlights opportunities for Chinese institutions to proactively leapfrog integrate interdisciplinary legal training in areas such as maritime environmental governance, cybersecurity, and AI liability. The student concludes with a phased proposal for curriculum reform aimed at strengthening China’s legal capacity in the global maritime domain.},

Through a bibliometric analysis of 18,776 relevant publications up to May 2025 from the Web of Science Core Collection, we investigated the interdisciplinary intersection between two keyword sets: 22 artificial-intelligence-related terms (including Machine Learning, Neural Networks, Symbolic Regression, Reinforcement Learning, etc.) and 22 fluid-mechanics-related terms (including CFD, Aerodynamics, Fluid-Structure-Interaction, etc.). Our systematic investigation employs a modeling-computation-application framework to analyze this interdisciplinary field, presenting the most active countries, institutions, research groups, and leading scholars while mapping the overall research landscape. Key findings include: (1) From 2000 to 2014, the number of publications and citations grew slowly, but since 2014, both have shown a significant increase. (2) AI applications in fluid mechanics are categorized into modeling (dimensionality reduction and knowledge discovery, machine learning-based turbulence modeling), computation (reduced-order models and feature extraction, machine learning-based CFD simulations), and applications (data fusion and reconstruction, multi-physics and multi-disciplinary coupling, intelligent flow control, aerodynamic shape optimization). (3) The United States dominates foundational research, while China leads in technological applications. (4) Multi-dimensional network analysis—including author, institutional, and national collaboration networks, along with co-citation patterns—reveals a pronounced spotlight effect among leading global universities and research teams. The twenty representative teams selected from them have important value in the academic and engineering fields and deserve further attention.

Drawing on data from a survey of 1021 Chinese university students, this study investigates the connections between AI knowledge, two modes of generative AI usage (GAU), and entrepreneurial ability, with a special emphasis on the moderating influence of individual creativity. The results indicate that AI knowledge positively influences entrepreneurial ability. Interestingly, two GAU modes (i.e., depth and breadth) serve as important mediators in the relationship between AI knowledge and entrepreneurial ability. Surprisingly, individual creativity enhances the mediation effect of GAU depth between AI knowledge and entrepreneurial ability but does not enhance the mediation effect of GAU breadth between AI knowledge and entrepreneurial ability. This study advances existing research by uncovering the mechanisms and boundary conditions that facilitate the transformation of AI knowledge into substantive entrepreneurial ability.

Nonetheless, the potential role of artificial intelligence (AI) and institutional quality in the energy transition-carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions relationship is rare and complex in the literature. To fill this critical research gap, this study performs empirical analyses of the relationship between AI and CO2 emissions in 35 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries between 1990 and 2020, considering the critical role of institutions and energy transition in enhancing the environmental advantages of energy transition and promoting Sustainable Development Goal 13 (SDG-13). To pursue the study's objective, the newly introduced Augmented Anderson-Hsiao (AAH) estimator, an efficient technique for panel data analysis, was employed. The AHH estimator's results indicate that a 1% increase in the green quality index significantly reduces CO2 emissions by approximately 66.7%. Additionally, AI has a negative impact on the environment through its detrimental effects on carbon emissions. Finally, institutional quality has a positive and significant impact on reducing CO2 emissions, indicating a beneficial effect on improving environmental performance. These findings highlight the importance of investments in AI-enabled sustainable technologies, robust institutional frameworks, and strategic regulatory measures to expedite global decarbonization.},

Drawing on self-regulation theory, we examine how and when GenAI dependence promotes or inhibits service innovation in the hospitality industry. Three studies were conducted to examine how GenAI is used in hospitality management and test the conceptual model: a three-wave questionnaire survey (N = 333), a quasi-field experiment (N = 227), and an in-depth interview (N = 11). The results indicate that GenAI dependence promotes service innovation by decreasing affective rumination, and this beneficial indirect path is amplified by employees’ neuroticism. Meanwhile, GenAI dependence inhibits service innovation by decreasing problem-solving pondering, and this unfavourable indirect path is weakened by employees’ conscientiousness. This exploration of when and how the use of GenAI either promotes or inhibits service innovation broadens our understanding of the consequences of GenAI dependence in the hospitality management field.},

    abstract = {Summary
The proliferation of microplastics (MPs) in aquatic and terrestrial environments poses significant threats to ecosystems and human health. Over the past 20 years, significant efforts have been dedicated to understanding the distribution, sources, and impacts of MPs. However, traditional methods for the detection and analysis of MPs rely on labor-intensive and time-consuming techniques, often lacking the needed precision. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative tool in environmental science, offering innovative solutions to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of MP analysis. Despite significant scientific advancements, there is a lack of critical review that consolidates the key applications of AI in MP analysis, synthesizes knowledge gained, and navigates for future research directions. This review is the first to thoroughly explore the exciting role of AI across the entire life cycle of MP analysis—from collection to characterization, dynamic modeling, impact assessment, and management of MP pollution. Specifically, AI-driven autonomous drones and robotics have emerged as promising solutions to revolutionize MP collection practices. Computer vision systems provide robust solutions for the identification and quantification of MPs in diverse environmental matrices. Additionally, data-driven modeling using machine-learning and deep-learning techniques facilitates accurate evaluation of MP pollution levels and their impacts, facilitating the design of effective management strategies. Despite these advancements, several knowledge gaps remain, including data scarcity and quality issues; the readiness of the AI models; and model interpretability, transparency, and reproducibility issues. Addressing these gaps requires the development of standardized protocols for improved data infrastructure, the adoption of more advanced and groundbreaking AI tools (such as generative AI), and the encouraging of multidisciplinary collaborations. Through these efforts, AI has the potential to revolutionize MP research, leading to a more comprehensive and effective response to MP pollution.},

Finally, various AI layout design algorithms are compared, and their effects and performances in layout design generation are analyzed. To verify the layout and composition matching model's performance, traditional layout design methods are selected for comparison (layout, comparison, harmonic composition, etc.). This study involved 20 design students as participants, evaluating them across three dimensions: overall comprehensive assessment, readability of text information, and rationality of visual path using a Likert 7-point scale. The results reveal that the proposed method's evaluation outcomes in these three aspects are 5.95, 5.68, and 5.74, respectively, higher than the traditional layout design methods.

    abstract = {Background and purpose
Tumor hypoxia is linked to lower local control rates and increased distant disease progression during head and neck (HN) radiotherapy. 18F-fluoromisonidazole (18F-FMISO) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging measured hypoxia can aid dose selection for HN patients, but its availability is limited. Hence, we tested the hypothesis that an artificial intelligence (AI) model could synthesize 18F-FMISO-like images from routinely acquired 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET images in order to predict primary tumor or metastatic lymph node hypoxic volumes.
Materials and methods
One hundred and thirty-four (training = 84, validation = 13, testing = 21, additional testing = 16) HN carcinoma patients, treated with chemoradiotherapy between 2011 and 2018 and scanned at treatment baseline with 18F-FDG PET/computed tomography (CT) and 18F-FMISO dynamic PET/CT, were analyzed. A pix2pix-architecture-based generative adversarial network was trained to yield 2D voxel-wise FMISO hypoxia images of target-to-blood ratios (TBRs) directly from the 18F-FDG PET/CT image slices. The hypoxic volume was defined consistent with clinical procedure as the malignant volume with TBR values above 1.2. The AI model hypoxia predictions were compared against scaled 18F-FDG PET values.
Results
The AI model hypoxic volume predictions were well-correlated with 18F-FMISO hypoxic volumes on the held-out test subjects (Pearson correlation testing R = 0.96, additional testing R = 0.91, p < 0.001). Predictions from globally scaled 18F-FDG PET images also produced a significantly correlated but worse prediction.
Conclusion
Voxel-wise prediction of hypoxia for HN cancers from a 2D deep learning model using FDG-PET images as inputs was shown to be feasible. Testing on larger institutional and multi-institutional cohorts is required to establish generalizability.},

However, previous studies have mainly focused on how individual factors affect GAI risk perception while the technical functions and features that are the root causes of user concerns regarding GAI remain unclear. To address this gap, the current study, grounded in affordance theory, explored how perceived affordances of GAI influenced user risk perceptions across six dimensions: information, security, technical, social, ethical, and legal. A hierarchical regression analysis was conducted on a survey of 1,031 GAI users to examine the impact of interactivity, agency, and security affordances on these risk dimensions. The results indicate that higher perceptions of affordances such as bandwidth, synchrony, and transparency are significantly associated with lower risk perceptions across all dimensions. Notably, women reported higher perceived risks than men in most categories, whereas age and GAI usage experience did not significantly affect these perceptions. These findings highlight the importance of enhancing user control, transparency, and privacy protections in GAI system design to effectively mitigate perceived risks. This study contributes to the literature by providing a multidimensional analysis of risk perception in the context of GAI, offering practical insights for the development of inclusive, transparent, and user-centered artificial intelligence systems.},

The analysis revealed that the awe experience significantly influences AIGC users' preferences to continue using the technology. Positive awe had a significant positive effect, while threatened awe had a comparatively weaker negative effect. The four features (accuracy, competence, anthropomorphism, and interactivity) of AIGC contribute significantly to its users' continued usage intention.

Objectives
Can conversational artificial intelligence (AI) help alleviate orthodontic patients’ general doubts? This study aimed to investigate the performance of conversational AI in answering frequently asked questions (FAQs) from orthodontic patients, with comparison to orthodontists.
Materials and Methods
Thirty FAQs were selected covering the pre-, during-, and postorthodontic treatment stages. Each question was respectively answered by AI (Chat Generative Pretrained Transformer [ChatGPT]-4) and two orthodontists (Ortho. A and Ortho. B), randomly drawn out of a panel. Their responses to the 30 FAQs were ranked by four raters, randomly selected from another panel of orthodontists, resulting in 120 rankings. All the participants were Chinese, and all the questions and answers were conducted in Chinese.
Results
Among the 120 rankings, ChatGPT was ranked first in 61 instances (50.8%), second in 35 instances (29.2%), and third in 24 instances (20.0%). Furthermore, the mean rank of ChatGPT was 1.69 ± 0.79, significantly better than that of Ortho. A (2.23 ± 0.79, P < 0.001) and Ortho. B (2.08 ± 0.79, P < 0.05). No significant difference was found between the two orthodontist groups. Additionally, the Spearman correlation coefficient between the average ranking of ChatGPT and the inter-rater agreement was 0.69 (P < 0.001), indicating a strong positive correlation between the two variables.
Conclusions
Overall, the conversational AI ChatGPT-4 may outperform orthodontists in addressing orthodontic patients’ FAQs, even in a non-English language. In addition, ChatGPT tends to perform better when responding to questions with answers widely accepted among orthodontic professionals, and vice versa.},

Secondly, the physical-virtual model towards intelligent system in digital twin is summerized to utilize simulating real prototype and virtual reality, especially physical-virtual prototype, subsystems, and artificial intelligent-enhanced digital twin system. Finally, owing to the machine learning and artificial intelligence, the next-generation digital twin system with advnaced sensing, physical-virtual system, and artificial intelligent-enhanced in various applications in one system would be the future trend. This review not only systemly reports digital twin from sensing component, the fundamental theory to the physical-virtual prototype, and artificial intelligence-enhanced technologies, it also presnets the future trajectory of the next-generation of digital twin as well as the challenges for various potential applications.},

    abstract = {Aim
This study aims to identify the most critical factors influencing nursing students' behavioral intention to use generative artificial intelligence by developing a network structure.
Background
Generative artificial intelligence is increasingly integrated into nursing education and clinical nursing practice. Studies have explored the factors influencing behavioral intentions toward the use of Artificial Intelligence, but research specific to Generative Artificial Intelligence is still lacking. It's crucial for nursing students to use generative artificial intelligence effectively, especially as clinical environments change rapidly in the digital era. Thus, it is important to identify the key factors that influence their intention to use.
Methods
A cross-sectional study was conducted. 800 participants were recruited from November to December 2023 through convenient sampling. Network analysis was applied in this study to identify the important nodes that are the most critical target goals for improving the behavioral intention of using Generative artificial intelligence by R package.
Results
The network analysis indicated that Artificial Intelligence Relevance, Ethical Awareness About Artificial Intelligence served as central factors in the network of Generative Artificial Intelligence Intention of using (EI = 1.19, 1.06). Artificial Intelligence Literacy was a key bridge node linking the Generative Artificial Intelligence Intention of using with its influencing factor associations (BEI = 0.33).
Conclusions
Generative Artificial Intelligence Relevance, Ethical Awareness about Generative Artificial Intelligence and Generative Artificial Intelligence Literacy serves as potential targets for enhancing nursing students' behavioral intention. Nursing educators and universities could consider targeted and collaborative effort to improve their behavioral intention.},

    abstract = {People experience the world through multiple senses simultaneously, contributing to our sense of place. Prior quantitative geography studies have mostly emphasized human visual perceptions, neglecting human auditory perceptions at place due to the challenges in characterizing the acoustic environment vividly. Also, few studies have synthesized the two-dimensional (auditory and visual) perceptions in understanding human sense of place. To bridge these gaps, we propose a Soundscape-to-Image Diffusion model, a generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) model supported by Large Language Models (LLMs), aiming to visualize soundscapes through the generation of street view images. By creating audio-image pairs, acoustic environments are first represented as high-dimensional semantic audio vectors. Our proposed Soundscape-to-Image Diffusion model, which contains a Low-Resolution Diffusion Model and a Super-Resolution Diffusion Model, can then translate those semantic audio vectors into visual representations of place effectively. We evaluated our proposed model by using both machine-based and human-centered approaches. We proved that the generated street view images align with our common perceptions, and accurately create several key street elements of the original soundscapes. It also demonstrates that soundscapes provide sufficient visual information places. This study stands at the forefront of the intersection between generative AI and human geography, demonstrating how human multi-sensory experiences can be linked. We aim to enrich geospatial data science and AI studies with human experiences. It has the potential to inform multiple domains such as human geography, environmental psychology, and urban design and planning, as well as advancing our knowledge of human-environment relationships.},
